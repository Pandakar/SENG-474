# Fake News Classification

This repository contains resources and code for a course project in the Data Mining course (SENG 474) at the University of Victoria for Spring 2017. Our motivation for this project is to build a fake news classification tool that utilizes machine learning for determining the reliability of news articles. The end goal is to have a tool that can take in news articles as input and output a classification for the news article along with the reasoning used for the classification.
