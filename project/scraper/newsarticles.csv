The decision came after Trump, who ran as a master deal-maker, failed to reach agreement with a bloc of rebellious conservatives. Moderate-leaning Republican lawmakers were also bailing on the legislation, leaving it short of votes.

House Republicans met behind closed doors Thursday night to consider their next steps, and emerged later saying they will vote Friday afternoon even though leadership is still trying to secure the votes.
Senior White House adviser Steve Bannon told reporters as he left the meeting that the administration wants a vote.
Budget director Mick Mulvaney told lawmakers, ""Negotiations are over. We'd like to vote tomorrow and let's get this done for the American people.""



The cancelling of Thursday's vote came on the seven-year anniversary of former president Barack Obama signing the Affordable Care Act, years that Republicans have devoted to promising repeal.
Those promises helped them keep control of the House and Senate and win the White House, but now, at the moment of truth, they are falling short.
""No deal,"" House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows, a Republican from North Carolina, said after he and his group of more than two dozen rebellious conservatives met with Trump to try to get more concessions to reduce requirements on insurance companies.

The Republican legislation would halt Obama's tax penalties against people who don't buy coverage and cut the federal-state Medicaid program for low earners, which the Obama statute had expanded. It would provide tax credits to help people pay medical bills, though generally skimpier than Obama's statute provides. It also would allow insurers to charge older Americans more and repeal tax boosts the law imposed on high-income people and health industry companies.
The measure would also block federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year, another stumbling block for Republican moderates.

In a danger sign for Republicans, a Quinnipiac University poll suggested that people disapprove of the Republican legislation by 56 per cent to 17 per cent, with 26 per cent undecided. Trump's handling of health care was viewed unfavourably by six in 10.
The survey was conducted March 16 to 21 with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Republican leaders had targeted Thursday for the climactic vote, in part because it marks the seventh anniversary of Obama's signing the measure into law. With the House in recess awaiting the outcome of the White House meeting, C-SPAN aired video of that signing ceremony.

House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, couldn't resist a dig.
""You may be a great negotiator,"" she said of Trump. ""Rookie's error for bringing this up on a day when clearly you're not ready.""
In a count by The Associated Press, at least 30 Republicans said they opposed the bill, enough to defeat the measure. But the number was in constant flux amid the 11th-hour lobbying.

Including vacancies and expected absentees, the bill would be defeated if 23 Republicans join all Democrats in voting ""no.""
Obama declared in a statement that ""America is stronger"" because of the current law and Democrats must make sure ""any changes will make our health-care system better, not worse for hardworking Americans."" Trump tweeted to supporters, ""Go with our plan! Call your Rep &amp; let them know.""

Tension has been building in advance of the critical vote, and a late-night meeting of moderate-leaning members in Speaker Ryan's office Wednesday broke up without resolution.
A key moderate who had been in the meeting, Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, issued a statement saying he would be voting ""no"" on the health bill. ""I believe this bill, in its current form, will lead to the loss of coverage and make insurance unaffordable for too many Americans,"" said Dent, a leader of the Tuesday Group of moderate-leaning Republicans.

Congressional leaders have increasingly put the onus on the president to close the deal, seemingly seeking to ensure that he takes ownership of the legislation — and with it, ownership of defeat if that is the outcome.
Moderates were given pause by projections of 24 million Americans losing coverage in a decade and higher out-of-pocket costs for many low-income and older people, as predicted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-ryan-health-care-bill-house-delay-vote-republicans-1.4038417?cmp=rss

The death toll from the attack rose to four on Thursday when police announced a 75-year-old man ""died tonight after his life-support was withdrawn.""
Masood was born in Kent to the southeast of London and had been most recently living in central England, London police said.
""Masood was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack,"" police said in a statement. ""However, he was known to police and has a range of previous convictions for assaults, including GBH [grievous bodily harm], possession of offensive weapons and public order offences.""
Earlier, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said the attacker had been investigated by British intelligence ""some years ago.""

May said he had been investigated by MI-5, the U.K.'s intelligence service, ""in relation to concerns of violent extremism,"" but that he was not part of what she called the current intelligence picture, saying he was a ""peripheral figure.""
Masood sped across Westminster Bridge in a car, ploughing into pedestrians along the way, then ran through the gates of the nearby Parliament building and fatally stabbed an unarmed policeman before being shot dead.

May and British police say they believe he acted alone and was ""inspired by international terrorism."" She said there is no reason to believe that ""imminent further attacks"" are planned.
She called Wednesday's events ""an attack on free people everywhere.""

ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, claimed responsibility for the attack, the group's Amaq news agency said on Thursday. The group has been responsible for numerous bloody attacks around the globe, but also has claimed certain attacks in a show of opportunism.



Forty people were injured and 29 remain in hospital, seven of whom are in critical condition. 


Those still in hospital include:


A Mormon church official says a Utah man was one of the people killed and his wife was seriously wounded and remains in hospital. Kurt W. Cochran and his wife, Melissa, were on the last day of a trip celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary on Wednesday when the attacker struck.
The church said Thursday the Utah couple was also visiting the woman's parents who are Mormon missionaries in London.
And earlier, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said a British national whose mother is Spanish has been identified as one of the people killed.

A spokesman said that Spanish consular officials made contact with Aysha Frade's relatives in Spain's northwestern region of Galicia after her identity was confirmed. He was unable to give any further details.
The regional Voz de Galicia newspaper said that Frade was 43 years old and was teaching Spanish in London.
The identity of the 75-year-old who died Thursday was not immediately clear.

Westminster Bridge has reopened, nearly 24 hours after the attack. 
Some areas around Parliament were still cordoned off on Thursday morning and a line of forensic investigators in light blue coveralls were on their hands and knees, examining the scene where the attacker was shot.
Queen Elizabeth sent her condolences on Thursday to those affected by the attack.
""My thoughts, prayers, and deepest sympathy are with all those who have been affected by yesterday's awful violence,"" she said in a statement. The Queen was due to officially open the new headquarters of London's police force on Thursday but will now do so at a later date.
Britain's Parliament this morning observed a minute of silence to mourn the victims.  
Flags at Parliament have been lowered to half-mast.



Since the attack, police have raided six addresses, including in London and Birmingham, which have resulted in eight arrests in total.
Mark Rowley, assistant commissioner with the Metropolitan Police, said they are continuing to investigate the attacker's ""motivation, his preparation and his associates.""
May and Rowley said there will be an increased police presence in the city, including armed and unarmed officers, as well as more patrols.



The policeman has been identified as Keith Palmer, 48.
Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, whose brother was killed in the Bali terror attack in 2002, performed first aid on the wounded police officer, who later died. About 10 yards away lay the assailant.
""I tried to stem the flow of blood and give mouth to mouth while waiting for the medics to arrive but I think he had lost too much blood,"" Ellwood said. ""He had multiple wounds, under the arm and in the back.""

May praised Palmer, calling him a hero who ""devoted his life to the service of his country."" She said the husband and father had been a member of the parliamentary and diplomatic protection command for 15 years. He had also been a soldier in the Royal Artillery. 
In Parliament Thursday, Conservative MP James Cleverly called for Palmer to receive posthumous recognition for his ""gallantry and sacrifice.""
Choking back tears, Cleverly said he first met Palmer 25 years ago as ""Gunner Keith Palmer"" when both men served in the Royal Artillery.
Cleverly said Palmer was ""a strong, professional public servant and it was a delight to meet him again only a few months after being elected.""


Romanian officials say the woman who plunged into the River Thames was a Romanian tourist in London to celebrate her boyfriend's birthday.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Ionut Valcu said Thursday that the woman fell into the Thames. It wasn't clear if she jumped or was thrown into the water by the SUV.
Romanian Ambassador Dan Mihalache told Realitatea TV late Wednesday that the woman sustained serious head injuries and has badly damaged lungs. Her boyfriend suffered a foot fracture. The pair haven't been named.
Mihalache said: ""They were tourists, unfortunately they were unlucky. They had come to celebrate his birthday."" He said the pair planned to wed.


A 26-year-old Portuguese man was among the injured.
Francisco Lopes told Portuguese channel TVI that he heard shouts behind him as he walked across Westminster Bridge and, when he turned around, he was struck by the vehicle which had mounted the sidewalk.

He said he lost consciousness and woke up racked with pain. He sustained cuts on a knee and a hand but was released from Chelsea-Westminster hospital after treatment.
""I was lucky,"" said Lopes, who lives in London with his mother.
Portuguese authorities confirmed that consular officials provided assistance to Lopes.
Here is how the attack on Wednesday unfolded:

But the gunshots were startling.
In a country where 500 counterterrorism investigations are underway at any one time, the sight of masked men with guns was frightening — all the more so at the foot of Big Ben.
And so mid-afternoon , London had to take just a moment to compose itself.
""This is a day that we had planned for, that we all hoped would never happen. But sadly it is now a reality,"" said Mark Rowley, the Metropolitan Police's head of counterterrorism.

In the indifferent rush of a London workday, a man armed only with a car and a knife was bound to slip through, killing three people before police shot him dead.
Painful, surely, for the security services, because London hasn't seen an attack of this scale since 2005. And in less than four years, police have managed to foil 13 Paris-style attacks — a fact they just shared with the public earlier this month.

Police have so many examples, they've started making podcasts for the public about how they brought down real-life plots.  

But just as surely as a lone attacker would eventually evade London's security services and 24-hour surveillance, London was bound to recover quickly when it did happen.

Once the initial horror was over, the resilience that comes with living for years with a severe threat of attack resurfaced. Severe means an attack is ""highly likely.""
Once out of lockdown, people with backpacks and bikes left quietly. Black cabs arrived to pick up customers. Construction workers in yellow vests within view of Big Ben started up again.
Courteous civil servants politely refused interviews because, one took the time to explain, civil servants aren't supposed to talk to the press.
Others were happy to discuss the inevitability of it all.
""It was expected at some stage that something like this would happen in the U.K.,"" said a woman who had been under lockdown in a building near Westminster.
""We were just lucky it hasn't happened before now.""

Police, too, knew it was coming. Just four days ago, they staged the latest in a never-ending rotation of police exercises that simulate attacks. In this one, it was a hijacked tourist boat. Just a chance to demonstrate competence to deal with such attacks, God forbid one should happen, said a police spokesperson.
But it did happen. In  very real scenario, the attack happened at the entrance to the world's oldest Parliament.

And there — just as it was — the attack was met with defiance.
""Parliament buildings all over the democratic world are under threat from those who want to destroy democracy and freedom. They won't succeed,"" said Conservative MP Martin Vickers, who was inside Parliament when the attacker struck.
Labour MP Chris Bryant, who had been under lockdown for hours without information, came out insisting that Parliament sit as usual today.
Hours earlier, Parliament's Twitter account had said it would, and Prime Minister Theresa May later confirmed as much.

Near Westminster, we're reminded that a few blocks away, plaques commemorate the lives of civilians killed in bombings during the Northern Ireland conflict.
""I have always worked in this area, so I was here when the IRA bombed it so — you kind of get used to it,"" said Michael Burrell. ""It's just terribly sad.""
London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, said ""Londoners will never be cowed by terrorism.""

There will be more armed and unarmed police on the streets, at tube stations, around Westminster. There will be tension over the Islamist connection to the attacks.
But yesterday, even with the backdrop of tragedy, London's usual, brash soundtrack played on.
Just a short distance away from the bridge where people had lost their lives, pub patrons sipped on lager, taking stock of the day. A woman snapped a photo of a display at a clothing store.
Thousands of Westminster workers were starting their way home on foot, busy talking on phones.
The phrase heard most often: ""I love you.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/resilience-of-londoners-resurfaces-in-wake-of-deadly-attack-1.4036719?cmp=rss
cd6674c001db0c3940191a636f1931318ee5224e,Ciara Long,2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,Canada suspends meat imports from 2 Brazil plants in food scandal,"The Canadian government has suspended imports from two Brazilian meat producers under investigation for allegedly doctoring and selling rotten meat while paying officials to turn a blind eye. 
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced earlier this week it was banning beef and poultry products from JBS and BRF, two of the world's biggest meat companies.
Some other jurisdictions went further: Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Japan and the European Union have banned imports from those producers as well as the other 20 smaller plants implicated in the investigation. On Thursday, China also confirmed a ban after its initial ambiguous measures left hundreds of tons of meat adrift at sea and shipping companies unable to deliver meat or use the country's ports as their transshipment points, as they usually do.

The scandal emerged last Friday after Brazil's national police announced the findings of a two-year investigation involving the meat producers' practices and alleged corruption among some government officials.
The investigators allege that JBS and BRF disguised inedible beef, pork and chicken, bound for both domestic consumption and export, by injecting the meat with chemicals and acids to improve its appearance and smell; by mixing expired meat with healthy meat; and by fleshing out meat that was considered weak with water and low-cost starch, such as manioc flour.
Both companies deny any wrongdoing, while Brazilian politicians downplayed the scandal. Ministry of Agriculture spokesperson Eumar Novacki said at a news conference that consuming meat from these companies posed only ""very small risks"" for consumers, while Brazilian President Michel Temer called the scandal ""a fuss.""

That has done little to reassure the 150 countries that the two companies export to. 
""The reputation of Brazilian beef, and indeed all Brazilian agricultural product, will be tarnished — I have no doubt about that,"" Prof. Chris Elliot, founder of the Institute for Global Food Security, told CBC News. ""For Brazil, being such a large meat-producing country and exporting so much across the world, it seems to be quite remarkable that there's such a widespread fraud going on.""

Investigators say Operation Weak Meat uncovered evidence of bribes paid to Brazilian officials, including some at the federal Ministry of Agriculture, to look the other way. Police issued 38 arrest warrants and closed 21 meat-packing facilities for further inspection.
Brazil's federal Justice Minister, Osmar Serraglio, was allegedly caught on tape calling one of the inspectors under investigation ""big boss"" in a phone conversation with one of the leaders of the bribery scheme in Parana state.
Serraglio, who oversees the investigating police force, said the police raids prove he is not interfering in the inquiry. Police in Brazil said there was insufficient evidence to launch a separate investigation into the minister's involvement. 

Prof. Decio Zylbersztajn, founder of Agribusiness Intelligence Center-PENSA, told CBC News in an email that he was not surprised by the scandal.
""Agribusiness is not more or less involved with corruption than any other sector,"" Zylbersztajn said. ""Opportunism is a reality that must be faced by governments and corporations.""
Brazil exported $5.9 billion worth of poultry and $4.3 billion worth of beef in 2015, with Japan, Russia and the Middle East being its principal customers. JBS and BRF account for a significant percentage of this trade.
Canada imports US $53 million worth of animal products from Brazil every year, according to MIT's , but there's no way of knowing how much Brazilian meat really makes it into Canadian supermarkets because the global supply chain is complicated.

Elliott says tracing a meat product's end destination is trickier than it seems. It is ""absolutely"" possible that the U.S. — which bought US $297.8 million of Brazil's meat in 2016 — processes meat from Brazil and sells it on to Canada.
""One of the most complicated supply chains in the world is red meat, particularly processed red meat,"" said Elliott. ""Food is a true global commodity, and knowing where your food comes from is close to impossible in many cases.""

Brazil relies on agribusiness as a key sector for stability as it struggles to pull itself out of recession. But Prof. Felipe Serigati, of the Sao Paulo School of Economics, told CBC News he doesn't expect the scandal to impact Brazil's economic recovery.
""Although the meat sector is important, the economy isn't going to grow more or shrink because of these events,"" Serigati said. ""There are very few economic sectors that could, in isolated form, destabilize the Brazilian economy,"" said Serigati.
However, Elliott anticipates the scandal will have worldwide consequences, provoking a rise in commodity prices globally. He also believes that similar arrangements — bribing officials to grade unsuitable meat as edible for consumption — will be uncovered in other countries that export large amounts of meat, as importers begin tighter inspections after Brazil's revelation.
""Over the next few weeks, you will see that this scandal will spread,"" he said. ""It's not just Brazil.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/brazil-canada-meat-scandal-1.4038121?cmp=rss

""You have newspapers today which receive documents 48 hours after they were seized in searches, for example in my office in the National Assembly. Who gives them these documents? The government,"" he said in a television interview.
Asked if politicians or the justice system gave approval for this, Fillon said: ""I will go much further. I blame the president of the republic.""

Hollande ""condemns with the greatest firmness the false allegations of Fillon,"" the president's office said on Thursday.
Once the front-runner in the French presidential election, Fillon has been mired in a scandal over public money he paid his wife to be his parliamentary assistant.

The Associated Press, which cited two unnamed sources, said Tom Shannon — who is undersecretary in the State Department — will issue the approval tomorrow.
That move would clear the way for the White House to approve the pipeline.
""We'll have an update on that for you tomorrow,"" White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Thursday.
Politico earlier reported that the approval would come by Monday, which is the last day in a 60-day timeline set in motion by U.S. President Donald Trump back in January, when he issued an executive order that invited Calgary-based TransCanada Corp. to reapply for a presidential permit. The order also instructed the U.S. State Department to ""take all actions necessary and appropriate to facilitate its expeditious review."" 

The 1,900-kilometre, 90-centimetre diameter pipeline would bring about 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Hardisty, Alta., through Montana and South Dakota to Steele City, Neb. There it would tie into the existing Keystone pipeline, which carries oil to Illinois and Texas.
""We do anticipate a decision by the State Department during the 60 days they have been given,"" TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha told CBC News in an email statement. ""At the moment, we continue to work with the administration on our presidential permit application.""
Approval from the U.S. government is not the final hurdle for the project. It still needs to win approval in Nebraska. A decision from the Nebraska Public Service Commission is expected in late September, Politico said.
The project also needs approval from landowners in the state.

""All of the approvals are in place north of the 49th parallel [for Keystone XL],"" Carr said Thursday on Parliament Hill. 



Keystone XL was originally rejected by then president Barack Obama, who turned it down in November 2015 saying it ""will not serve the national interests of the United States.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/keystone-approval-us-government-1.4037797?cmp=rss

Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld described the suspect as a hacker, but said his motives were still unclear. Israeli media identified him as an American-Israeli dual citizen and said he had been found unfit for compulsory service in the Israeli military.
""He's the guy who was behind the JCC threats,"" Rosenfeld said, referring to the dozens of anonymous threats phoned in to Jewish community centres in North America, as well as Australia, New Zealand, and in Israel over the past two months.
In Canada, threats have been made recently to Jewish community centres in , Calgary, , 
The U.S. Anti-Defamation League says there have been more than 120 bomb threats against U.S. Jewish community centres and day schools in the U.S. since Jan. 9. Those threats led to evacuations of the buildings, upset Jewish communities and raised fears of rising anti-Semitism. The threats were accompanied by acts of vandalism on several Jewish cemeteries.

The threats led to criticism of the White House for not speaking out fast enough. Last month, the White House denounced the threats and rejected ""anti-Semitic and hateful threats in the strongest terms.""
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions says the arrest shows the Justice Department will not tolerate religious-oriented attacks.
Sessions said in a statement Thursday that the arrest is the result of a large investigation into hate crimes against the Jewish community. He says the Justice Department ""will not tolerate the targeting of any community in the country on the basis of their religious beliefs.""
He called work by the FBI and Israeli police ""outstanding.""

In a statement, JCC Association of North America president and CEO Doron Krakow applauded the work of law enforcement and emphasized the group's community centres are safe.
""We are gratified by the progress in this investigation, and applaud the commitment and leadership of the FBI and other federal agencies, Israeli law enforcement, and local law enforcement across the United States and Canada,"" said Krakow.

""Throughout this long running period of concern and disruption that we are hopeful has come to an end, JCCs have had the opportunity to review and assess our security protocols and procedures, and we are confident that JCCs are safer today than ever before.""

The head of a Jewish community centre in New Jersey that had been targeted by bomb threats says he's thankful that U.S. and international law enforcement prioritized the investigation and have caught a suspect.Jordan Shenker, head of the Kaplen JCC on the Palisades in Tenafly, N.J., says he is cautiously optimistic that the man arrested in Israel on Thursday acted alone and that the threats will be over.
Shenker says the arrest has led to a feeling of being able to exhale, but that the centre has always prioritized security and will continue to do so.
U.S. authorities also arrested a former journalist from St. Louis for allegedly threatening Jewish organizations. Juan Thompson has been indicted in New York on one count of cyberstalking.
But Israeli police described the local man as the primary suspect in the wave of threats.
Israeli police said the suspect made dozens of calls claiming to have placed bombs in public places and private companies, causing panic and ""significant economic damage,"" and disrupting public order, including by the hurried evacuations of a number of public venues around the world. 
Rosenfeld said the man called Delta Airlines in February 2015 and made a false threat about explosives aboard a flight from JFK airport in New York. The threat allegedly led to an emergency landing.

Rosenfeld said the man, from the south of Israel, used advanced technologies to mask the origin of his calls and communications to synagogues, community buildings and public venues. He said police searched his house Thursday morning and discovered antennas and satellite equipment.
""He didn't use regular phone lines. He used different computer systems so he couldn't be backtracked,"" Rosenfeld said.
Yaniv Azani, head of technology in the Israeli police's cyber unit, says the man used ""several different means to camouflage the various layers of communication mechanisms"" to carry out the calls.
Nimrod Vax, co-founder of U.S.-Israeli cybersecurity firm BigID, says the phone calls required a certain level of sophistication, but were ""not too difficult"" for an experienced hacker
After an intensive investigation in co-operation with FBI representatives who arrived in Israel, as well as other police organizations from various countries, technology was used to track down the suspect, Rosenfeld said.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/israeli-jewish-man-arrested-threats-1.4037564?cmp=rss

Trump Jr. tweeted : ""You have to be kidding me?!: Terror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan."" The tweet included a link to a Sept. 22 story from Britain's Independent newspaper that included Khan's quote to the Evening Standard days earlier.

Voronenkov, who testified to Ukrainian investigators and criticized Russian policies after his move to Kyiv last fall, was shot dead by an unidentified gunman near the entrance of an upscale hotel in the Ukrainian capital.
The assailant also wounded Voronenkov's bodyguard, who fired back and wounded the gunman. Both were hospitalized but Ukrainian media cited hospital doctors later in the day as saying the gunman had died.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said Voronenkov's killing ""clearly shows the handwriting of Russian special services shown repeatedly in various European capitals in the past.""
In a statement released by his spokesman, Svyatoslav Tsegolko, Poroshenko described the victim as a key witness who gave testimony about ""Russian aggression"" to the Ukrainian authorities.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed the claim of Russian involvement in the killing as ""absurd"" in a statement carried by Russian news agencies.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova went further, saying the ""killer regime"" in Kyiv ""will do its best to make sure that no one will ever know the truth about what happened.""
She added that Russia was shocked to hear Poroshenko's accusations without offering any evidence and as Ukrainian police were inspecting the crime scene.
Several hours after Voronenkov was killed, a team of investigators and police were seen working at the front door of the Premier Palace hotel, which is frequented by Kyiv's rich and powerful. The patch of the pavement by the door where he died was wet from water that utility workers had used.
Poroshenko said it wasn't accidental that Voronenkov's killing came on the same day as the fire that erupted at a Ukrainian military arsenal in the Kharkiv region, which Ukrainian officials said was caused by sabotage.

Voronenkov, 45, a former member of the communist faction in the lower house of Russian parliament who had obediently toed the Kremlin line, moved to Ukraine with his wife, singer Maria Maksakova, who was also a lawmaker. He said he had to leave Russia because of persecution by Russian security agencies and had renounced Russian citizenship. He had been granted Ukrainian citizenship.
He testified to Ukrainian investigators as part of their probe into the activities of the nation's former Russia-friendly president, Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted by massive protests in February 2014.

After his move to Ukraine, Russian investigators filed fraud charges against Voronenkov in connection with his business activities. A Moscow court earlier this month sanctioned his arrest in absentia.
Ukraine's chief prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, said Voronenkov was shot in the head, neck and stomach and died on the spot.
Lutsenko said the gunman carried a Ukrainian passport and had been sought by the authorities on fraud and money laundering charges.
Lutsenko said investigators were looking into Voronenkov's role in exposing a contraband ring in Russia which cost several senior security officers their jobs, and also his testimony on Yanukovych, as possible motives behind his killing.
Nikolai Kovalyov, the former Russian security chief who is a lawmaker, told Russian state television that the killing could have been rooted in a business dispute.
Peskov said that Putin was informed about Voronenkov's killing and voiced hope that Ukrainian authorities would solve the crime. He added that Voronenkov's widow was welcome to return to Russia.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/russian-lawmaker-shot-in-ukraine-kyiv-1.4037467?cmp=rss

French President François Hollande compared the incident to the attack in London that that left three people dead Wednesday, saying the Frenchman was ""trying to kill people or create a dramatic event.""

The federal prosecutor's office said the car was intercepted late Thursday morning at the port docks and police arrested a man, identified as 39-year-old Mohamed R., who has been living in France.
In the car, authorities found knives, a shotgun and a gas can with an unknown liquid. There were no immediate reports of injuries.

An official at the prosecutor's office, who asked not to be identified because the investigation was continuing, said the suspect ""was under the influence,"" but refused to elaborate whether it was drugs or alcohol.
Authorities immediately raised security in the centre of Antwerp.

At first sight, the incident appeared to have the hallmarks of several extremist attacks in Europe — a vehicle in a busy area bent on mowing down pedestrians. Trucks were used last year in deadly attacks in Nice and Berlin, and an SUV was used Wednesday in London, where three people died in a rampage close to the British Parliament. The attacker was shot dead by police.
The office said ""because of these elements, and the events in London yesterday, the case is being taken on by the federal prosecutor's office,"" which usually deals with extremist attacks.

Prime Minister Charles Michel said ""we remain vigilant. Our security services have done excellent work."" He also expressed sincere condolences to British Prime Minister Theresa May, saying the two nations are ""working in close co-operation with our security and intelligence services.""
The high-speed event happened a day after Belgium held anniversary remembrance services for the Brussels airport and subway attacks, which killed 32 people on March 22, 2016.
Belgium has been living under the second highest anti-terror alarm ever since. Soldiers in the busy shopping street Thursday were immediately involved in trying to control and stop the car, which was speeding away at high speed.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/antwerp-belgium-car-crowd-london-attack-1.4038227?cmp=rss

Sure, many have written off the game shows as mindless and low-brow. But the trio of game shows put out by Chuck Barris, , have had a lasting legacy.
Robert Thompson, a pop culture and television professor at Syracuse University, said Barris's ""fingerprints"" are all over more current shows like   and the franchise.
""He had come up with that idea way earlier and it took a while for the rest of these other people to realize what he had.""

The show launched in 1965 to great success. It wasn't the first game to try and get people together without them seeing each other (the U.S. version of started in 1949) but Thompson said Barris brought the concept into the ""hip new era of the 1960s.""
He says  ""took one of those ideas that had been floating around since the 1940s, established it in a big hit show and that virus then spread all over the place.""


 
Thompson thinks the show was Barris's ""most enduring legacy.""
A fair point considering similar shows that sprung up abroad, including Britain's and Australia's .

Soon after, in 1966, Barris launched a show pitting married couples against each other with pretty funny results. It's where host Bob Eubanks coined the phrase ""making whoopie,"" a slang term for having sex which 


 
John Brunton of Insight Productions, a producer who helmed reality shows like and  said proved that Barris had a knack for mining people for entertainment.
""I think that it was tapping into the comedy of couples,"" he said.
""He turned the cameras back on real people.""

Barris took a turn with this 1976 daytime game show, which saw him hosting bizarre amateur performers who were trying to avoid the gong of the celebrity judges. The show specialized in bad acts.
In this format, Brunton said Barris was one of the original people to create ""really compelling television and comedy out of bad talent.""


 
It's become a staple of reality television today — from the nightmare performances that get the X on the franchise to the terrible singers who show up in the early audition stage of the  series.
""He changed the definition of comedy in a way, and it wasn't written comedy,"" Brunton said. ""It was found comedy."" 

Barris would go on to produce and oversee other shows, including flops like  and . But he had already cemented his influence.
""I think Chuck Barris was way ahead of his time. He was making these dating shows long before everybody else figured out what a great genre this could be,"" Thompson, the university professor said.
""If we want to realize what a brilliant artist Chuck Barris was, we have to totally rethink the criteria we use in evaluating what exactly is art.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/chuck-barris-legacy-1.4036333?cmp=rss

Republican Devin Nunes's comments led the committee's ranking Democrat, Adam Schiff, to renew his party's calls for an independent probe of Trump campaign links to Russia in addition to the Republican-led panel's investigation. Schiff also said he had seen ""more than circumstantial evidence"" that Trump associates colluded with Russia.
In back-to-back news conferences at the Capitol and then the White House — where he had privately briefed the president — Nunes said he was concerned by officials' handling of the communications in the waning days of the Obama administration.


He said the surveillance was conducted legally and did not appear to be related to the current FBI investigation into Trump associates' contacts with Russia or with any criminal warrants. And the revelations, he said, did nothing to change his assessment that Trump's explosive allegations about wiretaps at Trump Tower were false.
Still, the White House immediately seized on his statements in what appeared to be a co-ordinated public display.
Moments after Nunes spoke on Capitol Hill, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer read his statements from the White House briefing room podium. The California congressman quickly headed up Pennsylvania Avenue to personally brief the president and to address reporters outside the West Wing. Nunes's decision to brief the president was particularly unusual, given Trump almost certainly has access to the information from his intelligence agencies.
Jackie Speier, a Democratic lawmaker from California, said Nunes's disclosure could be a ""weapon of mass distraction"" in light of allegations of co-ordination between Russians and the Trump campaign during the 2016 campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton.
""This could be a lot of theatrics,"" said Speier, also a member of the House intelligence committee.

Outside the White House, Nunes said, ""What I've read bothers me, and I think it should bother the president himself and his team.""
Trump said he felt ""somewhat"" vindicated by the Republican's revelations. ""I very much appreciated the fact that they found what they found,"" he said.
The disclosure came two days after FBI Director James Comey publicly confirmed the bureau's own investigation into the Trump campaign's connections with Russia and rejected Trump's explosive claims that President Barack Obama wiretapped his New York skyscraper during the election. Comey's comments came during the intelligence committee's first public hearing on Russia's election interference, an investigation being overseen by Nunes.
Nunes briefed reporters on the new information without consulting with Schiff, and that did not sit well with the top Democrat on the committee.
Schiff declared he now has ""profound doubt"" about the integrity and independence of the committee's probe. He said that ""a credible investigation cannot be conducted this way.""
Later, in an interview with MSNBC, Schiff said evidence ""that is not circumstantial and is very much worthy of an investigation"" exists of Trump associates colluding with Russia as it interfered in last year's election. He did not outline that evidence.

Nunes said he believed the Trump team's communications were caught ""incidentally."" But he suggested the contents may have been inappropriately disseminated in intelligence reports. He left open the possibility the communications were spread for political reasons. Nunes would not disclose how he received the new information.
It was unclear whether Trump's own communications were monitored. Nunes initially said ""yes"" when asked if Trump was among those swept up in the intelligence monitoring, but then said it was only ""possible.""
It's common for Americans to get caught up in U.S. surveillance of foreigners, such as foreign diplomats in the U.S. talking to an American. Typically, the American's name would not be revealed in a report about the intercepted communications. However, if there is a foreign intelligence value to revealing the American's name, it is ""unmasked"" and shared with other intelligence analysts who are working on related foreign intelligence surveillance.
Schiff disputed Nunes suggestions that there was improper ""unmasking."" He said that after speaking with Nunes, it appeared that the names of Americans were still guarded in the intercepts though their identities could be gleaned from the materials.
Obama administration officials disputed the suggestion that the outgoing administration was improperly monitoring its successors. Ned Price, who served as spokesman for Obama's National Security Council, said Nunes's assertions ""were nothing more than an attempt to offer a lifeline to a White House caught in its own netting following President Trump's baseless tweets.""
Matthew Waxman, a national security law professor at Columbia University, said Nunes's actions ""in this case are contributing to, rather than alleviating concerns, about politicization of intelligence.""
Nunes said the information on the Trump team was collected in November, December and January, the period after the election when Trump was holding calls with foreign leaders, interviewing potential Cabinet secretaries and beginning to sketch out administration policy. He said the monitored material was ""widely disseminated"" in intelligence reports.
Asked whether he believed the transition team had been spied on, Nunes said: ""It all depends on one's definition of spying.""
Nunes did not identify any of the Trump associates he said were ""unmasked,"" but they are believed to include Michael Flynn, who was fired as White House national security adviser after misleading Vice-President Mike Pence and other top officials about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the United States.​",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/spying-claim-by-u-s-intelligence-committee-chair-renews-fight-over-russia-probe-1.4037017?cmp=rss

James Harris Jackson turned himself in at a Times Square police station early Wednesday, about 25 hours after Timothy Caughman staggered into a police precinct bleeding to death.
""I'm the person that you're looking for,"" Jackson told police, according to Assistant Chief William Aubrey.
Jackson, who was arrested on suspicion of murder, told police he'd harboured feelings of hatred toward black men for at least 10 years, authorities said. He travelled to New York on March 17 and had been staying in a Manhattan hotel.
""The reason he picked New York is because it's the media capital of the world and he wanted to make a statement,"" Aubrey said.
Jackson was wandering the streets in a long overcoat concealing a 26-inch sword when he encountered Caughman, who was collecting bottles from trash cans, police said. Jackson stabbed him repeatedly in his chest and back, they said.
Caughman, who was 66 years old and lived nearby in a transitional house, was taken to a hospital by police shortly after he arrived to the station house. He died at the hospital. According to his Twitter page, he was an autograph collector and a music and movie lover who tweeted about John Lennon, Chuck Berry and the best St. Patrick's Day writing. He said he'd like to visit California someday.
After the attack, Jackson, who's 28, went to the bathroom of a nearby restaurant and washed off the blood from the killing, authorities said.

Investigators said they believed Jackson was considering other attacks but surrendered after noticing his photo in media reports. He had two knives and told investigators where they could find the sword, police said. The sword was retrieved from a trash can not far from the scene.
Video surveillance captured Jackson in the days leading up to the attack, and investigators said he had walked purposefully toward a black man but didn't attack him.
Jackson said nothing to reporters as he was led from a police station. A call to his family's home phone rang unanswered.
A former neighbour who tangled with Jackson over an apartment in Baltimore recalled him as ""a piece of work"" who fell months behind on rent.
""He's just one of those people that you wish you never met,"" said Marcus Dagan, who had been informally managing the building on behalf of its then-owner and took Jackson to court over the rent.
Dagan said Jackson moved out in 2015 without paying.
When Jackson moved in in 2014, he indicated he was a military veteran and was in college, studying toward becoming a lawyer, Dagan said. Jackson left behind a collection of war movies in the apartment, the former neighbor said.
Jackson was in the Army from March 2009 to August 2012 and worked as a military intelligence analyst, the Army said. Deployed in Afghanistan from December 2010 to November 2011, he earned several medals and attained the rank of specialist.
The circumstances of his discharge are unclear; the Army cites privacy laws that prevent releasing such details.
Bias attacks have more than doubled this year in New York, and there have been nine bias crimes against black people reported, up from five in the same time period last year.
Mayor Bill de Blasio said the sword killing was ""an assault"" on the city's inclusiveness and diversity. The Democrat called it ""an unspeakable human tragedy"" and urged city residents to ""speak clearly and forcefully in the face of intolerance and violence.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/nyc-killing-race-crime-allegations-1.4037280?cmp=rss

More than 300 people — most of whom were students on a high school trip — died when the Sewol sank on April 16, 2014, touching off an outpouring of national grief and soul searching about long-ignored public safety and regulatory failures. The public outrage over what was seen as a botched rescue job by the government contributed to the recent ouster of Park Geun-hye as president.
Workers on two barges began the salvaging operation Wednesday night, rolling up 66 cables connected to a frame of metal beams divers spent months putting beneath the ferry, which had been lying on its left side in about 44 metres of water.
By 3:45 a.m., Sewol's stabilizer surfaced from the water. About an hour later, the blue-and-white right side of ferry, rusty and scratched and its name ""SEWOL"" no longer visible from where it was, emerged for the first time in more than 1,000 days.

By about 7 a.m., the ferry had been raised enough for workers to climb on it and further fasten it to the barges.
Lee Cheoljo, an official from the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, told reporters that workers will need until late afternoon or the evening to raise the ferry until its upper side is about 13 metres above the surface.
Workers had initially planned to do this by Thursday morning, but were forced to a temporarily halt when the ferry began rubbing against pulleys and other equipment on the barges as it came up, Lee said. They resumed lifting the ferry after spending hours on operations to better balance it.
Once Sewol is raised to the desired point, salvage crews will then load the ferry onto a semi-submersible, heavy-lift vessel that will carry it to a mainland port. The loading process, including emptying the ferry of water and fuel, is expected to take days.

The bodies of 295 passengers were recovered after the sinking on April 16, 2014, but nine are still missing. Relatives, some of whom who are watching from two fishing boats just outside the operation area, are hoping that those remains will be found inside the ferry.
""I can see it. I can see where my daughter is,"" Park Eun-mi, the mother of a missing 17-year-old girl, told a television crew as her boat approached the salvaging site on Wednesday. Lee Geum-hee, the mother of another missing student, said, ""We just want one thing — for the ship to be pulled up so that we can take our children home.""

Once the ferry reaches a port 90 kilometres away in the city of Mokpo, in about two weeks, workers will begin clearing the mud and debris and search for the remains of the missing victims. An investigation committee will also be formed to search for clues that could further explain the cause of the sinking, which has been blamed on overloaded cargo, improper storage and other negligence.
A group representing the families of the victims issued a statement demanding that it be part of the investigation committee. Many bereaved family members and their supporters have been demanding a more thorough investigation into the government's responsibility over the sinking, questioning why higher-level officials have not been held accountable.
The ferry's captain survived and is serving a life sentence after a court found him guilty of committing homicide through ""wilful negligence"" because he fled the ship without issuing an evacuation order.
Park was forced to defend herself against accusations that she was out of contact for several hours on the day of the sinking. The allegations were included in an impeachment bill lawmakers passed against Park in December, amid broader corruption suspicions.
Park was formally removed from office by the constitutional Court earlier this month. She is now under criminal investigation over suspicions that she conspired with a confidante to extort money and favours from companies and allow the friend to secretly interfere with state affairs.
In a meeting with Cabinet ministers, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, South Korea's acting head of state, urged officials to do their best to ensure a successful job salvaging the ferry, and instructed them to plan a thorough and quick investigation once the ferry reaches the Mokpo port.
Salvaging the huge, corroded ferry from a channel notorious for dangerous currents has been a difficult and expensive job. South Korea agreed in 2015 to an 85.1 billion won ($76 million US) deal with a consortium led by China's state-run Shanghai Salvage Co. to do it.
While many large shipwrecks around the world have first been cut into sections to be raised, this was never an option for Sewol because there are hopes of finding the remains of the missing victims inside the wreckage.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/sewol-tragedy-korea-ship-salvage-1.4037368?cmp=rss

In a release, the Department of Homeland Security announced the news  on flights to the U.S. from eight Middle Eastern and North African nations.

Although the full details of the U.S. plan had yet to emerge, the U.K. government moved swiftly to announce a similar plan, albeit one that targets different devices from a smaller pool of airports.
suggested that U.S. carriers might be somewhat exempt from the rules, but the Homeland Security release specifically says the new rules will be enforced as of Friday on all airlines ""at 10 select airports where flights are departing for the United States.""

But even that is a back-handed way of targeting foreign airlines, since at press time, no U.S. carriers offer direct flights to any of the airports named. Which is why the rules achieve the desired result, since the logistics of a selective ban would be even worse.
""If it's some sort of play to favour U.S. carriers,"" Calgary-based independent airline analyst Rick Erickson said in an interview, ""that simply can't be the case.""
Erickson says it's not hard to imagine two travellers flying to the U.S. on separate flights out of the same airport. One is on an airline covered by the ban, and one is not.
If terrorism concerns are the point of the ban, ""once you get through security you could just give your device to your buddy,"" he said.

Others aren't so sure that security issues are the only forces at play. In short, ""there might be some competitive questions here as well,"" says Henry Farrell, an associate professor of political science at George Washington University in D.C.
In an interview with CBC's Tuesday, Farrell said he can't help but notice that the targeted airports are all the major hubs of three airlines based in the Persian Gulf: Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways.

More than half of the roughly 50 daily flights that will be affected by the ban come from those three airlines, which have made huge gains on legacy carriers in North American and Western European airlines in recent years.

Governments heavily subsidize the operations of all three, allowing them to offer better service at lower prices than other carriers. Which is why biggest three U.S. airlines — American, Delta and United — .
""These airlines have been very, very nervous ever since Trump came into office that they may be in the target sights,"" Farrell said. So this move could be nothing more than ""the Trump administration is giving U.S. airlines a boost by knocking down their competitors.""
That's because they all cater to high-end Western business travellers by giving access to Asia on luxurious planes via a hub-and-spoke system — and all their main hubs have just been made less desirable.
""If you're a business class or first class passenger,"" Farrel says, ""you're probably going to be quite worried"" about not having access to your laptop during a 15-hour flight. ""You're very likely to choose a different airline.""




Others agree with that assessment. ""It may not have been directed at the three Gulf airlines, but there will be collateral damage to those carriers,"" San Francisco-based travel analyst Henry Harteveldt said. ""The question is how much.""
Differing security rules and protocols at different airports has added to the confusion in the interconnected air travel network. Canada hasn't immediately moved to match the new rules, but that's a clear possibility eventually.
""A decision on whether to implement a similar ban respecting large electronics on flights to Canada will be made shortly,"" Transport Canada said in a statement to CBC News.

""For security reasons, we cannot elaborate on aviation security concerns. Transport Canada continuously assesses our security and makes adjustments whenever needed.""
Security issues aside, Farrell says one obvious impact will be to compel travellers between the West and Asia to choose their routes more carefully.



""If you're trying to travel onwards on to India, you might be best advised to travel with a different airline,"" he says.
That describes Paula Berger to a tee. The energy company manager was trying feverishly on Tuesday to rebook an upcoming business trip scheduled to depart from Houston through Dubai and on to her company's branch office in Hyderabad, India.
""I've been spending hours this morning trying to find a way to reroute us without it costing $5,000, but I haven't found anything,"" Berger said. ""We might have to suck it up.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/electronics-travel-ban-business-1.4034590?cmp=rss

Four people were killed, including the assailant, and 40 others were injured in what Prime Minister Theresa May condemned as a ""sick and depraved terrorist attack.""
Lawmakers, lords, staff and visitors were locked down after the man was shot by police within the perimeter of Parliament, just metres from entrances to the building itself and in the shadow of the iconic Big Ben clock tower. He died, as did two pedestrians on the bridge, and the police officer.

A doctor who treated the wounded from the bridge said some had ""catastrophic"" injuries. Three police officers, several French teenagers on a school trip, two Romanian tourists and five South Korean visitors were among the injured.
Police said they were treating the attack as terrorism. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
Metropolitan Police counterterrorism chief Mark Rowley said police believed there was only one attacker, ""but it would be foolish to be overconfident early on."" He said an unarmed policeman, two civilians and the attacker died.
He identified the police officer who died as Keith Palmer, 48.

Islamic extremism was suspected in the attack, Rowley said, adding that authorities believe they know the assailant's identity but would not reveal it while the investigation was ongoing.
The threat level for international terrorism in the U.K. was already listed at severe, meaning an attack was ""highly likely.""
Speaking outside 10 Downing St. after chairing a meeting of government's emergency committee, COBRA, May said that level would not change. She said attempts to defeat British values of democracy and freedom through terrorism would fail.
""Tomorrow morning, Parliament will meet as normal,"" she said. Londoners and visitors ""will all move forward together, never giving in to terror and never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us apart.""



London has been a target many times over past decades. Just this weekend, hundreds of armed police took part in an exercise simulating a ""marauding"" terrorist attack on the River Thames.
Wednesday was the anniversary of suicide bombings in the Brussels airport and subway that killed 32 people last year, and the latest events echoed recent vehicle attacks in Berlin and Nice, France.

In the House of Commons, legislators were holding a series of votes on pensions when deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle announced that the sitting was being suspended and told lawmakers not to leave.
Parliament was locked down for several hours, and the adjoining Westminster subway station was shuttered.

Conservative lawmaker Tobias Ellwood, whose brother was killed in 2002 in the Bali bombing, performed first aid on the wounded police officer, who later died. About 10 yards away lay the assailant.
""I tried to stem the flow of blood and give mouth to mouth while waiting for the medics to arrive but I think he had lost too much blood,"" Ellwood said. ""He had multiple wounds, under the arm and in the back.""

The attack began early Wednesday afternoon as a driver in a gray vehicle slammed into pedestrians on the bridge linking Parliament to the south bank of the River Thames.
Former Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski was in a car crossing the bridge when he heard ""something like a car hitting metal sheet"" and then saw people lying on the pavement.
""I saw one person who gave no signs of life. One man was bleeding from his head. I saw five people who were at least seriously injured,"" Sikorski told Poland's TVN24.

Ambulances arrived within minutes to treat people who lay scattered along the length of the bridge. One bloodied woman lay surrounded by a scattering of postcards.
Police said one injured woman was pulled from the river.
The car crashed into railings on the north side of the bridge, less than 200 metres from the entrance to Parliament. As people scattered in panic, witnesses saw a man holding a knife run toward the building.
""The whole crowd just surged around the corner by the gates just opposite Big Ben,"" said witness Rick Longley. ""A guy came past my right shoulder with a big knife and just started plunging it into the policeman. I have never seen anything like that. I just can't believe what I just saw.""

The attacker managed to get past a gate into Parliament's fenced-in New Palace Yard, a cobbled courtyard in the shadow of the Big Ben clock tower.
Daily Mail journalist Quentin Letts said a man in black attacked the police officer before being shot two or three times as he tried to storm into the building.

""As this attacker was running towards the entrance two plain-clothed guys with guns shouted at him what sounded like a warning, he ignored it and they shot two or three times and he fell,"" Letts told the BBC.
The attacker fell to the cobbles just yards from the entrance to 1,000-year-old Westminster Hall, the oldest part of the parliamentary complex, busy with visitors and school groups. Beyond that, a corridor leads to the building's Central Lobby, flanked by House of Commons and House of Lords chambers.

The prime minister was among lawmakers near the Commons at the time of the attack, and was quickly ushered away by security officers and driven back to Downing Street.
To get that far, the attacker would have had to evade the armed officers who patrol the Parliament complex in pairs, as well as Parliament's own security staff, who don't carry guns.
The attack unfolded near some of the city's most famous tourist sites, including the London Eye, a large Ferris wheel with pods that overlook the capital. It was halted after the attack, stranding visitors in the pods, with an aerial view of the attack scene.

London Ambulance Service said medics treated 12 people for serious injuries and eight who were less seriously hurt.
Dr. Colleen Anderson of St. Thomas' Hospital said some of the wounded had ""catastrophic"" injuries.
The French Foreign Ministry said that three students on a school trip from Saint-Joseph in the Brittany town of Concarneau were among the injured. Two Romanians were also among the injured, the country's Foreign Ministry said.



London has often been a target, from IRA campaigns in the 1970s and 80s to more recent Islamist plots.
On July 7, 2005, four al-Qaeda-inspired British bombers blew themselves up on three subway trains and a bus in London, killing 52 people.
British security forces say they have thwarted some 13 terror plots over the past four years, but in recent years the U.K. has largely been spared major international attacks such as the ones seen in Belgium and France.

The international community reacted to the London attack, with leaders from around the world expressing grief, solidarity and condolences.
""We are all saddened to hear about the incident in London, and I express my deepest condolences to the victims of this cowardly attack,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in the House of Commons on Wednesday.
""The scene is all too familiar to members of this House who were here 2½ years ago,"" he added, referring to .



German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a statement said she learned ""with sorrow"" of Wednesday's incident and her thoughts were ""with our British friends and all of the people of London,"" in particular those who were injured.
French President François Hollande told reporters outside Paris, ""We are all concerned with terrorism.
""France, which has been struck so hard lately, knows what the British people are suffering today.""
U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with May by telephone and applauded ""the quick response of British police and first responders,"" White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/london-parliament-attack-1.4035964?cmp=rss

The video marks the second time in recent months that the Chicago Police Department has investigated an apparent attack that was streamed live on Facebook. In January, four people were arrested after a cellphone footage showed them allegedly taunting and beating a mentally disabled man.
Police only learned of the latest alleged attack when the girl's mother approached the head of the police department, Supt. Eddie Johnson, Monday afternoon as he was leaving a department station in the Lawndale neighbourhood on the city's West Side, department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Tuesday. She told him her daughter had been missing since Sunday and showed him screen grab photos of the alleged assault.
He said Johnson immediately ordered detectives to investigate and the department asked Facebook to take down the video, which it did.
Guglielmi said Tuesday that detectives found the girl and reunited her with her family. He said she told detectives that she knows at least one of her alleged attackers, but it remained unclear how well they knew each other. He said investigators are questioning several people, but no one is considered a suspect yet and no arrests have been made.
He said Johnson was ""visibly upset"" after he watched the video, both by its content and the fact that there were ""40 or so live viewers and no one thought to call authorities.""
Investigators know the number of viewers because the count was posted with the video. To find out who they were, though, investigators would have to subpoena Facebook and would need to ""prove a nexus to criminal activity"" to obtain such a subpoena, Guglielmi said by email.
A spokesperson for Facebook, Andrea Saul, said she had no specific comment on the Chicago incident but that the company takes its ""responsibility to keep people safe on Facebook very seriously.""
""Crimes like this are hideous and we do not allow that kind of content on Facebook,"" she said.
Jeffrey Urdangen, a professor at Northwestern University's law school and the director of the school's Center for Criminal Defence, said it isn't illegal to watch such a video or to not report it to the police.

In an interview with CBC News, Edgars Rinkevics also shed further light on what circumstances might cause his country to trigger the Western military alliance's self-defence clause following a potential massive cyberattack.
Four multinational battalion-sized formations are setting up camp in eastern Europe as a check on Russian expansionism, and one of them will be led by Canada.
Roughly 400 German troops, who recently arrived in Lithuania, faced a series of bogus stories of sexual misconduct meant to drive a wedge between them and the local population.
""Of course, it was rubbish and nonsense, but if both governments and both militaries did not take immediate action … I think we would have been in quite a disaster,"" Rinkevics said Thursday after a series of meetings with Canadian officials.

He came away from a meeting with Canada's chief of defence, Gen. Jonathan Vance, reassured that ""appropriate measures are being taken.""
A series of defence experts, in Canada and elsewhere, have said the likelihood of a full-on Russian invasion of the Baltics is remote, and instead NATO troops will likely face attempts to discredit and destabilize the region through propaganda and cyberattacks.
Rinkevics said he agrees with those assessments.
The rules under which the four battle groups will operate, how they will be respond to provocation and what sort of authority military commanders have are still being hammered out at NATO.
""I am confident we are progressing well there,"" Rinkevics said.

One of the most delicate discussions involves how to respond to a massive cyberattack, which the alliance now considers to be on par with a conventional attack using troops and tanks.
The policy was adopted at the 2014 NATO leaders summit in Wales and solidified at the followup gathering of 28 member nations last summer in Warsaw.

But the leaders wouldn't say what circumstances would elicit a response in either cyberspace — or even the real world.
""We have deliberately decided to have vague language so a potential adversary doesn't mess with us,"" said Rinkevics.
""I think we all understand that if there is a cyberattack that take innocent lives; I think that this is an issue that would be of very serious concern to all of us. But we deliberately have chosen not to comment on what would be the red line.""
An attack on infrastructure that takes down government servers is one thing, but ""systems where you have people's lives at stake"" is something that takes it to another level, he said. ""I think in that case we would all treat such issues as Article 5 issues and we will come to defend each other.""

Canadian military officials have said troops deployed to Latvia — in both cyber and conventional terms — will operate in a defensive manner.
Conservative MP James Bezan, the party's defence critic, said he believes Canada needs to begin thinking clearly about how it moves from a defensive to an offensive posture.
""Russia or others, who are using the cyber world to destabilize, undermine and ultimately upset our Western democracies, if we continue to allow them to do it and get away with it without doing counter-cyberattacks to take out that capability, more and more of our partners, as well as Canada, are going to be at risk,"" he told CBC News in an interview.
Rinkevics is headed to Washington for further meetings with U.S. officials who have gone to great lengths to downplay the campaign rhetoric of President Donald Trump, who has called NATO obsolete, and the raised possibility he might not come to the defence of the Baltics.
The arguments have succeeded — for the moment.
""We believe we don't have any reason to doubt U.S. commitment to NATO,"" Rinkevics said.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-latvia-minister-1.4038841?cmp=rss

All NDP and nearly all Liberal MPs supported the motion, which passed 201-91. The majority of Conservative MPs voted against, with leadership candidate Michael Chong and Simcoe North MP Bruce Stanton voting in favour. Mississauga Liberal MP Gagan Sikand and Barrie Conservative MP Alex Nuttall both abstained.
The vote follows months of bitter debate and a series of protests and counter-protests across the country over whether the private member's motion would limit free speech or single out Islam for special treatment in Canadian law.



It had additional symbolic significance in the emotional aftermath of the Jan. 29 mosque shooting in Quebec City, where six Muslim men were killed.
The motion was tabled by Mississauga-Erin Mills Liberal MP Iqra Khalid on Dec. 5, 2016. She spoke to reporters after the motion passed Thursday.
""I'm really happy that the vote today has shown positive support for this motion and I'm really looking forward to the committee taking on this study,"" she said.
Khalid's motion calls on the government to do three things:

The latter would require the heritage committee to collect data on hate crime reports, conduct needs assessments for affected communities and present findings within eight months.

Liberals rejected an attempt by Saskatchewan Conservative MP David Anderson to  from the motion and change the wording to ""condemn all forms of systemic racism, religious intolerance and discrimination of Muslims, Jews, Christians, Sikhs, Hindus and other religious communities.
Anderson argued Islamophobia was not defined in Khalid's motion, and that its inclusion contributed to widespread confusion and fears about the effect on freedom of speech.
​

Khalid told reporters she didn't think changing the wording of her motion was the result of broad consultation and changing it wouldn't have led to Conservative support.
""It was a really collaborative effort amongst all Canadians and amongst all parliamentarians and I was not able to find consensus,"" Khalid said.
""Really, changing the wording of the motion would have watered it down and I think the committee can really look into this if it is an issue.""
Anderson, the Conservative who tried to amend the motion, said he didn't see much difference between himself and Khalid on the issue after the vote.

""I think that many of us have wanted to have a mature discussion about this for a long time, and I think actually Ms. Khalid and I would be on the exact same wavelength on that issue,"" Anderson said.
""The committee can do a good job and we can have a discussion about what this means for Canada, the role of Islam in Canada, and it's time we had that discussion and did it on a different level than we have over the last month.""
M-103 generated controversy on social media and through online petitions, with some incorrectly suggesting it is a ""law"" or a ""bill"" rather than a non-binding motion. Some have raised concerns it would lead to some form of Shariah law in Canada.
The NDP caucus voted in favour of both versions of the motion.

Gagan Sikand, the Liberal MP who abstained from the vote, said he made the decision based on correspondence with his constituents.
""Since the residents of Mississauga-Streetsville were fairly evenly split, I was of the opinion that abstaining best reflected everyone,"" he wrote in a Facebook post.
Sikand said he will ""always"" condemn Islamophobia and all forms of discrimination.




Some MPs, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, were not in the House for the vote.

A  published Thursday by the Angus Reid Institute suggests that 42 per cent of Canadians would vote against the motion, while just 29 per cent would vote in favour of it. About two-thirds of Conservative voters were against , while opinion was more divided among Liberals and New Democrats.
The poll suggests that Canadians have doubts the motion will accomplish anything. A majority of respondents said that the motion would have no real impact. Another 31 per cent felt it was a threat to freedom of speech, while 12 per cent believed it would help ""reduce anti-Muslim attitudes and discrimination.""

Only a week after characterizing Lyse Ricard's two-year investigation as having a racist element, Meredith is now taking a different tack, as he continues his fight to sit in the Red Chamber after having a sexual relationship with a teenage girl.
""Senator Meredith doesn't feel this whole issue, including the Senate's approach, is racially motivated,"" his new lawyer, Bill Trudell, said in an interview Thursday.
Meredith said just last week, ""Absolutely, racism has played a role in this,"" adding it was ""nothing new to me. There is always a double standard [for black men] that exists in this country.""
In a thinly veiled swipe at Meredith's former lawyer, Selwyn Pieters, Trudell said he'll try to defend Meredith, and his conduct, without resorting to racial politics.
""I think that is a position I would not advance, it doesn't address the issue. It's not something that will be addressed here,"" he said in an interview with Rosemary Barton on CBC's .
""Senator Meredith has made a serious mistake, but I firmly believe that everyone is bigger than his worst mistake, and I'm going to work hard to turn the temperature down and find a resolution as soon as possible,"" Trudell said, adding his client had used that defence ""because he is under a lot of stress.""

 had said Meredith was being portrayed as a ""sexual predator"" because he is an imposing black man. He said Caucasian senators have conducted equally questionable behaviour and yet still hold on to their seats in what he called the ""Rogue Chamber.""

Trudell said he will be consulting with constitutional experts to ascertain whether the Senate can expel his client.
Meredith, a 52-year-old Pentecostal pastor, was appointed as a Conservative senator by former prime minister Stephen Harper in 2010 before becoming a member of the Independent Senators Group (ISG).
He denies many of the allegations levelled against him by the woman in question — who is identified as ""Ms. M"" in the ethics report detailing the case — but has said he had sexual intercourse with her on at least one occasion when she was over 18.
Ricard's report found that Meredith violated two sections of the code of ethics, namely that he did not uphold the highest standards of dignity inherent to his position, and that his actions reflect adversely on the institution of the Senate.
Ottawa police investigated the matter but dropped the case without pressing criminal charges.
""A breach of the code by any one senator reflects adversely on the Senate and all senators and affects the ability of the Senate and all senators to carry out their functions,"" members of the ethics committee said in a statement released after their meeting.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau unveiled the proposed tax in Wednesday's budget.
An executive with Uber's Canadian operations on Thursday called it a ""tax on innovation"" that would hurt Uber drivers and users.

""At a time when Canadians spend far too much time stuck in traffic — and people should be encouraged to leave their cars at home, take public transit, and share rides — we should be supporting policies that make sustainable transportation more affordable, not more expensive,"" said Ian Black, regional general manager for Uber Canada, in a statement.
Morneau's proposed tax on Uber and other ride-hailing services would for the first time impose GST/HST on fares, much like they are added on traditional taxi services. The change will broaden the definition of a taxi business to ensure Uber and other web-based ride-hailing services are required to charge and remit the tax.
The change in the definition of a taxi business will go into effect on July 1.

The change would add just $3 million in additional revenue to Ottawa's coffers in 2017-18, but the federal budget suggests the measure is to help level the playing field and create tax fairness.
Uber disagrees with the government's approach.
""Federal tax laws already offer small business owners a break on collecting sales tax, but unfairly exclude taxi drivers,"" Black said. ""The best way to support taxi drivers and level the playing field is to extend the same exemption to them.""
Uber said it is hoping for ""meaningful"" consultation with the government on the issue.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/uber-gst-tax-budget-1.4038389?cmp=rss
f1621538cf87fa1d74aa8726603d6fced3cdeb4f,Elizabeth Thompson,2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,Access to tax credit for fertility treatments expanded in budget,"Many Canadians who have turned to assisted reproductive technologies over the past 10 years are now eligible for a tax break as a result of Finance Minister Bill Morneau's new budget.
Getting medical help to conceive a child can cost thousands of dollars, a cost that isn't covered by most provincial health plans.
The government estimates that one in eight Canadian couples experience infertility and ""an increasing number of Canadians, including single parents and same-sex couples, are turning to assisted human reproduction procedures to help build their families.""
Until now, Canadians had to be diagnosed as medically infertile to be able to claim the cost of reproductive technologies as part of their medical expense tax credit.

The change in Wednesday's budget opens the tax credit to those who aren't infertile, such as single women who want to have a child or a same-sex couple who want to start a family.

Moreover, the way the government has decided to proceed means the measure will also effectively be retroactive. By framing it as a clarification of the tax laws, it means that anyone who has incurred expenses over the past 10 years for reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization can refile their taxes for that year and claim the expense.

The government says it could eventually make the expenses associated with turning to a surrogate mother eligible as well, but wants to first wait for the results of a consultation launched by Health Canada to determine which expenses should be considered eligible.
Government officials say they have no idea how much the measure will cost. They say they don't know of cases where someone's expense was denied, but they also don't know if people didn't claim the expense because they weren't medically infertile and didn't believe they were eligible.
Dr. Jeff Roberts, president of the Canadian Fertility and Andrology Society, says an estimated 10,000 people turn to assisted human reproduction technologies in Canada each year, roughly 80 per cent of whom have been trying to conceive for at least a year and meet the definition of infertility.

Most provinces do not cover the costs of in vitro and other fertility treatments, so tax breaks make a big difference for those seeking treatment, he said. A single cycle of IVF can cost between $10,000 and $15,000.
""Anything is a help, because I see patients all day long who need treatments like IVF and just simply can't afford them.""


However, Aaron Wudrick of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation questioned the wisdom of allowing people to retroactively claim the expense.
""Anytime you go retroactively, you're opening up Pandora's box. I think that's probably not a good idea, especially if they have absolutely no estimate of what the cost would be,"" he said.

""If you're going to implement such a measure, it should be forward looking. If you're going to even think about something being retroactive, they have to have some cost estimate. Otherwise they are opening themselves up to considerable fiscal abuse there.""
Allowing an expense to be claimed retroactively also runs counter to the purpose of tax credits, said Wudrick.
""These credits are supposed to help people who might not otherwise be able to do something. If they are already doing it, doing it anyway, and you're just giving them a windfall, you're not really achieving the objective of the credit.""

Former Conservative cabinet minister James Moore said it was unusual for a government to allow people to claim expenses that have been made years ago.
""It's pretty rare to have a 10-year window, a retroactive window going back, for expenses that have already occurred,"" he said.
""So, I think what that signals is that the government doesn't expect this to be a big ticket item in terms of the costs that have been incurred so far.""

With women waiting until they are older to start families, the measure is a reasonable one, said Moore. He dismissed possible objections by those who may not support tax help for same-sex couples to have children.
""I suppose they are free to express their views, but in this country the charter of rights is very clear — all Canadians are treated equally under the law, and we don't discriminate in the tax code based on your sexual preference. If people want to start a family, they are entitled to start a family and the tax credit would apply equally to all Canadians.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/budget-fertility-tax-deduction-1.4037046?cmp=rss

The Associated Press, which cited two unnamed sources, said Tom Shannon — who is undersecretary in the State Department — will issue the approval tomorrow.
That move would clear the way for the White House to approve the pipeline.
""We'll have an update on that for you tomorrow,"" White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Thursday.
Politico earlier reported that the approval would come by Monday, which is the last day in a 60-day timeline set in motion by U.S. President Donald Trump back in January, when he issued an executive order that invited Calgary-based TransCanada Corp. to reapply for a presidential permit. The order also instructed the U.S. State Department to ""take all actions necessary and appropriate to facilitate its expeditious review."" 

The 1,900-kilometre, 90-centimetre diameter pipeline would bring about 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Hardisty, Alta., through Montana and South Dakota to Steele City, Neb. There it would tie into the existing Keystone pipeline, which carries oil to Illinois and Texas.
""We do anticipate a decision by the State Department during the 60 days they have been given,"" TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha told CBC News in an email statement. ""At the moment, we continue to work with the administration on our presidential permit application.""
Approval from the U.S. government is not the final hurdle for the project. It still needs to win approval in Nebraska. A decision from the Nebraska Public Service Commission is expected in late September, Politico said.
The project also needs approval from landowners in the state.

""All of the approvals are in place north of the 49th parallel [for Keystone XL],"" Carr said Thursday on Parliament Hill.

Fellow contenders Andrew Scheer and Erin O'Toole also improved their standings in the index thanks to some key political endorsements.
The index is a composite of four leadership race metrics (endorsements, contributors, fundraising and polls) that has been developed to help gauge the state of the 14-candidate race to replace Stephen Harper as the party's permanent leader. A full explanation of how the index works .
Maxime Bernier still tops the index with a score of 20.1 points (suggesting he would capture 20.1 per cent of the vote on the first ballot if that vote were held today), down slightly . O'Leary is next with 18.5 points, up 0.7 points, followed by Scheer at 13.3 points.
O'Toole, inching up to 9.9 points, has moved into fourth place. He displaced Leitch, who dropped 0.7 points to 9.5. 
Lisa Raitt and Michael Chong round out the top seven with 6.4 and 5.6 points, respectively. A full breakdown of the index can be found at the bottom of this article.

The highest profile endorsement over the past two weeks came from Gérard Deltell, a Quebec Conservative MP and last leader of the provincial Action Démocratique du Québec before it merged with the opposition Coalition Avenir Québec. Deltell threw his , putting the Ontario MP on the map in Quebec.
The value of Deltell's backing has boosted O'Toole to 10 per cent of the endorsement points available in the province (the index awards points according to an endorser's status —  for details).

O'Toole still ranks behind Scheer in endorsements nationwide, however. The Saskatchewan MP bolstered his Ontario support with four endorsements from the province, including three former MPs and a sitting MPP.
These four Ontario endorsements moved Scheer from fourth to second in the province with an 18 per cent share of Ontario's endorsement points, behind O'Toole's 24 per cent share.
The other candidates in the race lost endorsement point share as O'Toole and Scheer added to their tallies.

The index uses a rolling monthly average of polls of Conservative supporters or members. The only surveys conducted over the last month have been by Mainstreet Research for iPolitics. The polling firm interviewed Canadians who have previously donated to the federal Conservatives (or some of their provincial equivalents) and who say they are eligible to cast a ballot in the May 27 leadership vote.
Those sampled would not include new members who are interacting with the party for the first time or those who had donated less than $200 in any one year to the Conservatives in the past.

Leitch's polling score in the index has dropped by 3.1 points to 11.3 per cent. Though she managed 19 per cent support among decided respondents in the most recent Mainstreet/iPolitics survey, that was a sharp departure from the eight to 10 per cent she was registering among decided respondents in polls done in the three weeks prior.
Her score in the rolling average dropped because she had previously been polling as high as 24 per cent among decided respondents — well above Mainstreet's latest result.

There have been a few beneficiaries to Leitch's slip in the polling average over the past four weeks.
Ontario MP Raitt has been scoring around nine per cent among decided respondents in Mainstreet's polling, compared to her previous scores of four to seven per cent.

Scheer has been polling between nine and 12 per cent among decided respondents in recent weeks, compared to his five to seven per cent rating in Mainstreet's first waves of polling in January and early February.
O'Leary still holds an overall lead in the polls, managing between 25 and 29 per cent support, up a little from where he was when he started his campaign in January.
Bernier slipped in Mainstreet's latest sounding, conducted in the midst of O'Leary's  with membership sign-ups. Prior to that, he was scoring between 22 and 23 per cent.
O'Toole's endorsement strength has yet to show up in the polls. He is still scoring between just three and 5.5 per cent among decided respondents, ranking him behind Leitch, Raitt and Chong.
The other candidates in the race are Steven Blaney, Brad Trost, Pierre Lemieux, Chris Alexander, Andrew Saxton, Deepak Obhrai and Rick Peterson.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-index-mar23-1.4036072?cmp=rss
c84ee9ff3f64f17662debcabc234dd3a89c40dd6,Aaron Wherry,2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,Liberal budget offers lots of 'vision' but few new numbers: Aaron Wherry,"At a dozen points in the budget document, the Liberals interrupt their announcements to explain ""What Success Will Look Like.""
Canada, we are told at one point, ""will have one of the most skilled, talented, creative and diverse workforces in the world."" The country ""will be on the leading edge of discovery and innovation."" Commute times will be shorter. Cities will be more livable. The air will be cleaner. Being a parent will be easier.
That is what the Liberals are selling: a vision of what they hope will eventually be.
In lieu of a shiny new tax cut or benefit, that will have to suffice.
Because this wasn't particularly a budget about numbers.

Not until the seventh page of his 11-page budget speech did Finance Minister Bill Morneau offer what could be described as a ""new"" number: $11 billion for a national housing strategy.
But two caveats are necessary. First, the money is to be distributed over 11 years. And, second, all of it is covered by funding already announced for ""social infrastructure"" last fall. 
The total amount of new funding committed to ""building stronger communities and neighbourhoods"" for the next fiscal year is just $20 million. Indeed, across the entirety of this new budget, there is a mere $1.3 billion in ""new"" announcements and much of that is covered by reallocating funds that were previously committed.


""There's not a lot of new, new money in the budget,"" remarked one reporter when Morneau was presented to the journalists who spent the day locked up with the budget book. ""Is it that you overspent in the last one?""
""Our plan is very much about a long-term vision,"" responded the finance minister.
""We set about as soon as we got into office, dealing with middle class anxiety, increasing confidence in Canadians. We also set out long-term objectives for investment. And that's what we're identifying today, the long-term vision.""

A government official had actually already answered that reporter's question ahead of Wednesday's budget. ""The budget's a public policy document and I think the story will be much more into where the country needs to go as opposed to dollar amounts,"" the source told The Canadian Press earlier this week.
Budget has long since become a loose term, in Ottawa anyway. The annual spring exercise functions as more of an elaborate announcement of government priorities with big numbers attached than a detailed accounting of how public funds will be allocated.
But in this case, the government was very much limited in how many numbers it could throw around. First, by the commitments it has already made. Second, by its reluctance to raise new revenue.

A review of the tax system's various credits and exemptions, completed internally last year, holds the potential for new funds and Morneau warned that changes could be coming. ""Let me be clear,"" he said. ""All Canadians must pay their fair share."" But for now the tweaks are relatively minor.
That tax review joins a science review, a defence policy review and an expert panel's report on youth employment in remaining to be seen. Throughout the budget are references to other items and details that will become clear in the ""coming months,"" including a whole new organization to deal with skills development. A review of government spending is promised for next year's budget.

Still to be seen too, of course, is how Donald Trump will impact economic policies and tax rates in the United States. If the president is successful in dramatically reducing American rates, for instance, it might be harder for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Morneau to justify asking for a higher share here. Unless, of course, the economy significantly improves. 
All of which leaves this budget feeling something like a placeholder, even while it does any number of potentially interesting things.

There are more than 60 pages on skills development and innovation. There is a suggestion that 40,000 child-care spaces ""could"" be created in the next three years. And, in perhaps the government's bravest move of the day, the non-refundable public transit tax credit is eliminated: one of the Conservative government's inventions, the Liberals are scrapping it on the grounds that it doesn't result in significantly more people using public transit.

 
There are also a half-dozen measures that might be regarded as quintessentially Liberal.
A ""gender statement"" is attached to the budget to analyze how the government's measures will impact women and men differently. Funding is committed to create an LGBTQ2 secretariat within the Privy Council Office to assist the prime minister's LGBTQ2 adviser (Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault). A ""Prime Minister's Gold Medal"" in scientific excellence will be created. About $350 million is committed across several initiatives to help the government and its agencies collect more and better data.
Sprinkled within are references to ""superclusters"" and ""smart cities."" There will soon be a ""Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy."" 
But including last year's promises, it remains to be seen how much of it will be completed or demonstrable by October 2019, when the next election is scheduled to be held. The promised infrastructure bank is now scheduled to be up and running by late 2017. And much of the promised infrastructure spending is scheduled for the next decade.

On its signature commitment to infrastructure, the government cast its eyes to 2025. To see that day, the Liberals will have to be re-elected twice more. And for all that progress to seem secure, the federal government will also probably have to figure out how to balance the budget.
A vision is, by Morneau's account, part of what Canadians previously lacked (in addition to policies that addressed their stresses).
""People were left without a clear vision for growth at a time of unprecedented change,"" he told the House of Commons on Wednesday. 
So the Liberals are selling the vision thing.
Now they have just 2½ more years to make that seem like something more than a hazy dream.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wherry-morneau-budget-vision-1.4036870?cmp=rss

When Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his team of public servants began putting the final touches on his budget a few weeks ago, things could hardly have looked better for the economy.
Oil prices were in recovery, but in no danger of pushing the loonie up enough to discourage Canadian exports.
In fact, exports were looking strong, unemployment was falling. The U.S. economy seemed to be on a roll after the Trump bump sent stocks soaring.

Following President Donald Trump's coherent speech to Congress, business leaders were increasingly convinced that his odd tweets and bluster were only cover for a shrewd economic strategy. 
Now, of course, things don't look quite as good.
Oil has tumbled from above $55 U.S. a barrel to $48. Suddenly everyone is talking about overvalued U.S. markets and struggles ahead for the U.S. economy.

Trump seemed crazy like a fox after his speech to Congress. But following his latest statements, including accusations that former president Barack Obama had tapped Trump's phones, business leaders are beginning to fear it is not like a fox. 

But whether the economy is on a roll or if it is struggling against looming difficulties,  has made it clear this is no time to change the tax laws in favour of equality.
Even before the finance minister presented his budget yesterday afternoon, it had been widely signalled to the media that rumoured increases to capital gains taxes and cuts to large tax perks would not appear in this budget.

The left-leaning Broadbent Institute was among the few to be surprised enough to be annoyed.
""Rather than taking a bite out of the juicy tax loopholes that unfairly benefit the richest Canadians, the Trudeau government has offered up only a few stale crumbs,"" lamented institute executive director Rick Smith.
""Despite significant public attention, and overwhelming support for action, Budget 2017 completely ignores the inequitable tax treatment of stock options, capital gains and dividends, which are only available to the richest Canadians and which — every year — deprive the federal government of billions of dollars that could be spent to improve the lives of Canadians,"" said Smith in a release shortly after the budget.

On the other hand, people who are wealthy or who speak for the wealthy have been firmly against any increase on taxes for the rich.
On budget day itself, even after changes to capital gains seemed unlikely, investment adviser Som Sief made a case against more taxes on the wealthy because "".""
Montreal investor Stephen Jarislowsky said the government needed to """" over the idea of taxing the rich.
""We're trying to rebuild our economy, and I don't think you rebuild the economy by chasing people away who could deliver jobs and build corporations,"" said Jarislowsky.

As the , Morneau has put some of the details of Canada's budget plans on hold partly because of uncertainty about what the Trump administration will do next.
Trump says he will cut taxes for corporations and individuals. The implication is that if Trump does that, Canada may be forced to follow suit to prevent a run for the border by Canadian businesses and rich people.
Research by Stanford University using anonymized documents from the U.S. government shows that a border run is not as likely as some fear. A study of people moving from one state to another because of taxes showed rich people were less likely than others to leave their home state, despite different or changing tax rates.

""The rich are different from the general population,"" says . ""They more often have family responsibilities … that embed them in place. They own businesses that tie them to place. And their elite income itself embeds them in place: millionaires are not searching for economic opportunity — they have found it.""

In other words richer Canadians, often our respected friends and neighbours, are not likely to escape to Trump's polarized and possibly unstable United States for the sake of a few percentage points in taxes.
If taxes were to go up and some rich people left, they could be consigning themselves to greater unhappiness. 
A recent survey showed the  live in places where taxes are high and people feel more equal. Norway came in first. Canada was number 7. The United States was 14th on the list. 
Being equal also makes a country rich and innovative, according to the recent business book 
During and since his election campaign, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeated a commitment to equality.
""The benefits of growth must ... be felt by everyone,"" he tweeted on Labour Day last year.
Many Canadians, including rich ones, agree with him in principle. 
But when it comes to actually doing something, there are always plenty of good reasons why it's impossible just now. This budget is more evidence that there really never is a convenient time to increase equality.

In a speech to supporters in St. John's, N.L., the bombastic federal Conservative leadership candidate and reality TV star took aim at Notley and her economic policies.
""My message is this,"" O'Leary said. ""I will not tolerate mediocrity or incompetence at any level of government any more if I make a commitment to you to grow the economy three per cent.

""So I'll take another example. Let's take a Rachel Notley. She is beyond the measure of incompetent. She just let $12 billion leave. She's a vicious, poisonous, toxic cocktail of mediocrity, incompetence, put together. 

""She requires an extreme amount of adult supervision.
""Now I can't have her running the No. 1 piston of economic growth in Canada into the ground. The transfer payments out of Alberta in the last 35 years funded practically every province. And it's broken.""
Notley didn't directly address the content of O'Leary's comments when she was asked about them at a bridge announcement in Fort Saskatchewan later Thursday morning.
""There's a number of people in that particular race. Some of them are interested in generating attention through a whole series of fun, creative and somewhat wacky approaches to generating media attention,"" she said. ""Not really my plan to participate in that.""
This isn't the first time O'Leary has publicly criticized Alberta's NDP premier.
In January 2016, he said he would invest $1 million in the province's energy sector if Notley stepped down. He claimed she couldn't manage Alberta's resources and wanted her to make way for someone ""more qualified."" 

O'Leary said people ask him what he could to do ""incentivize"" Notley to have ""the proper economic behaviour.""
He said he would prescribe lowering corporate taxes, eliminating the carbon tax, giving tax incentives to encourage investment in the energy industry — ""all the things a good fiduciary would do.
""I would simply call her up — although I'm hoping that she won't be there when I arrive, because her popularity's in single digits now, she's lost so many jobs. 

""But let's say, through some nightmare, she was still there. I'd call her up, say, 'Look, we're going to work together on three-per-cent growth. These are the following things you're going to have to do. And if you don't — take carbon tax for example — I'll simply deduct it from your transfer payment.
""These are hard words, but we're going to need that kind of leadership and discipline to grow this economy three per cent. That's my focus.""
Notley said those remarks show O'Leary lacks knowledge about the workings of Canadian government.
""It demonstrates a significant misunderstanding of the authority that the prime minister of the country has, a distinct misunderstanding of the Constitution of the country, a distinct misunderstanding of many, many things,"" she said.
""But other than that, I'm not at all interested in responding. As I say, the candidates for the federal Conservative leadership are going to do a variety of things to garner attention. This is one of them. They can do that but that's not something I'm planning on being part of.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/rachel-notley-a-vicious-poisonous-toxic-cocktail-of-mediocrity-kevin-o-leary-charges-1.4037981?cmp=rss

From offering 18-month parental leave to targeting $7 billion of its infrastructure funding for child-care spaces, today's federal budget offers solutions to issues women often identify.
But it also laid out why this new shade of public policy looks good on everyone, regardless of gender.

Sixty measures in the 2017 federal budget affect men and women differently, according to analyses presented for the first time in their own budget chapter, on an equal footing with other chapters dedicated to tax fairness and the government's much-discussed skills and innovation strategy.
Women  to protest against a Trump administration perceived as hostile to women.
But the Canadian government has doubled down, trying to show it not only understands women's issues, but thinks solving them is smart fiscal policy.
""This is an instrument of change,"" Finance Minister Bill Morneau told host Rosemary Barton on  Wednesday, promising that his budget's gender statement would get ""more and more comprehensive"" in the future.
""It's going to help us to ensure that women are more successful in our economy."" 
Morneau's determined to get more women participating in the workforce. Currently, they make up 51 per cent of the population but 47 per cent of the labour force.
Gender-focused economic strategy could bring that number up.  
Data included in the budget document shows that while women's educational attainment has increased significantly over the last four decades, a substantial wage gap remains. 
Women are underrepresented in trades and disproportionately represented in lower-paying retail and social service sectors. In the private sector in particular, there are significantly fewer female executives.
Canada ranks relatively high among developed countries for women's overall participation in the labour market. But mothers are less likely to work compared with those in other countries with high-performing economies.
Immigrant women and Indigenous women face particular barriers, the budget said. Women and girls are more likely than men to experience poverty, violence and harassment.

How will the budget fix this?
The budget describes how Canada lags behind other countries in the affordability and the availability of regulated child-care spaces. 
Now a $7-billion slice of the $81-billion infrastructure package announced last November will be made available for early learning and child care. 
Provinces and territories will share jurisdiction over how this money is spent. But the budget suggests it could create up to 40,000 new subsidized child-care spaces and help train child-care workers to provide quality care. 
An unspecified portion will also be set aside for programs for on- and off-reserve Indigenous children.

The budget's analysis of skills training programs revealed a gender gap in the job training offered under existing funding agreements with the provinces and territories. 
Only 44 per cent of program participants were women, the budget said.
The budget's $2.7-billion training funding boost makes a ""renewed commitment"" to increase the workforce participation of underrepresented groups. New programs need to respond to more diverse needs, the budget says.

Whether it's construction jobs that benefit from infrastructure investments, or new venture capital designed to help high-tech startups grow, the underrepresentation of women in some industries means they're less likely to benefit from government funding.
Programs to attract young people to science and mathematics will try to create more gender balance in the future, the budget says. 
The budget also makes it easier for some students to qualify for federal grants and loans.
More than two-thirds of part-time students who receive federal assistance are women, and about 80 per cent of them are women with dependent children pursuing post-secondary education.
Finally, the budget discusses support for female entrepreneurs, something , although specifics on new money weren't offered Wednesday.

Changes to the employment insurance system may also help parents and caregivers who take a break from work for family reasons.
An 18-month parental leave — something discussed by both social policy advocates and  but never implemented by the federal government — will now be an option.
Parents can choose to take a longer leave at a lower benefit rate of 33 per cent of their eligible average weekly earnings instead of the 55 per cent rate currently offered for a 12-month leave.
If a maternity leave needs to start before a child is born, 12 weeks will now be offered instead of eight.
The budget also includes a new caregiving benefit of up to 15 weeks to allow workers time off to care for an injured or ill adult family member. 
Three tax credits currently available to caregivers have been simplified into one new caregiver credit the government says will help more people.

Morneau also highlighted the $101 million over five years for a strategy to address gender-based violence.
Other money is targeted for new gender and diversity training for judges in the wake of several  where judges were found lacking in their .

The budget's gender focus has obvious appeal for certain voters. But it may carry political risk.
Former Saskatchewan finance minister Janice MacKinnon suggests that the way this gender-based analysis is presented tells only part of the story.
Females are doing far better in the education system overall, she points out. Down the road, some traditional gender imbalances may disappear, and new ones could emerge. 
""There are issues out there,"" she said of the budget's focus on women. ""But there will be issues on the other side too.""
For example, men are overrepresented among older, laid-off manufacturing workers. The budget is silent on 
""Eventually there may be a quiet backlash,"" MacKinnon said.
""What helps with gender inequality is when people are treated equally,"" interim Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose told reporters. ""These measures cannot just be for women; they have to be for all workers.""
The federal government has been talking about  since 1995, but . In some areas, data still isn't available to measure it.
Sahir Khan, now with the University of Ottawa but formerly of the parliamentary budget office, says the government's ability to go beyond documenting the problem and work on solving it remains an open question.

Budget 2017, titled Building a Strong Middle Class, offers targeted investments to tackle what it calls the ""challenge of change."" It offers little new spending, but fleshes out details on where dollars earmarked in last fall's economic update will be spent.
The budget delivers $1.18 billion this year on skills and innovation, nearly half of which has already been announced.


Other targeted programs for new investment range from child care and social housing to training for jobless youth, Indigenous people and other Canadians to adapt to the transforming economy.

But some of that money will not begin to flow for years down the road.

""We will continue to invest in our people, our communities, and our economy while maximizing every dollar and ensuring it is well spent,"" Finance Minister Bill Morneau said in the House of Commons.

His budget speech was delayed more than 30 minutes because of filibustering by the Conservatives over proposed changes to parliamentary procedures.

The female-friendly plan includes measures to support female entrepreneurs, expanded eligibility for tax credits for fertility treatments and new flexibility for Canadians to spread out parental leave from the current 12 months to 18 with reduced payments.


The spending plan also includes some smaller revenue grabs, including a new tax on ride-sharing services like Uber, cancellation of the Canada Savings Bond and new taxes on tobacco products and alcohol. A non-refundable transit tax credit brought in by the previous Conservative government has also been scrapped.


But former Saskatchewan finance minister Janice MacKinnon said the 278-page budget document delays much-needed measures for keeping businesses, jobs and opportunities in Canada in the wake of the election of U.S. President Donald Trump.

""I see this budget as a bit of a pause. It's a pause in the spending, from the big spending last time to virtually no new spending this time, and also a pause because of what is happening in the United States,"" said MacKinnon.

""Donald Trump is there and his message is clear: he's going to help the middle class by reducing taxes, reducing regulations, not proceeding with helping the environment, and we're going in the opposite direction.""


The budget provides more details about the government's previously announced $81.2-billion infrastructure plan, including $11 billion for affordable housing over 11 years and $7 billion over 10 years to create new child-care spaces.

Some of the other key budget details:



The budget offers no timeframe of when the government will balance the books.

The budget predicts the economy will grow slightly this year, keeping the ratio of federal debt to GDP fairly flat for the next five years, at 31.6 per cent in this year compared with 31.5 per cent last year.


Sprinkled through the budget are other spending initiatives, some of which draw on previously announced allocations:


Morneau said in his speech in the Commons that consumer spending is up since the government introduced the Canada child benefit, and the economy has seen the largest seven months of job gains Canada has seen in a decade.

""These are good, early signs of a plan that is working,"" he said.

Interim Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose slammed the budget for ""nickel and diming Canadians to death"" through rescinded credits, new taxes and user fees. She accused government of being out of step with the needs of ordinary Canadians, putting the interests of venture capitalists ahead of family farmers, oil drillers and salon workers.
""If you're a guy who takes the bus to work and back, or to university and back and when you get home you like to have a beer, well both of those things are going to cost you more,"" she said.
Ambrose said the budget also misses an opportunity to take steps to combat Trump's ""aggressive"" move to cut taxes for individuals and businesses.


The government had floated several trial balloons in the run-up to the budget, including proposals to tax capital gains and privatize federally owned airports, which were left out of the budget.
NDP Leader Tom Mulcair said if the government had closed a stock option tax loophole it could have netted $720 million that could have helped children living on First Nations reserves.
He also criticized the government or delaying the roll-out of new money for critical programs.
""There is not one penny for child care next year,"" he said. ""The lack of affordable quality child care is one of the things that affects women negatively in terms of their economic livelihood. It's a shame the Liberals have not made that a priority despite all their promises.""



The budget creates Innovation Canada, with $950 million over five years to support innovators and build hubs for innovation known as ""super-clusters.""

Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at the CIBC, said government can only do so much to prepare for the digital economy; education systems and the private sector must do the heavy lifting.

Shenfeld said it's positive that the government is recognizing the nature of work is changing, but whether the measures to spur innovation announced today will have a positive impact is to be determined.

""These are always experiments, because it's like every government introduces new skills training programs and we have to wait and see how they work,"" he said.

""But at least they're not creating big boondoggles where corporations apply for money … thinking that is going to push innovation.

The extraordinary measure is contained in Finance Minister Bill Morneau's budget, tabled Wednesday in the House of Commons.
The Liberal government at the same time announced an additional $624 million in spending over several years on veterans programs, much of it aimed at helping smooth the transition for ex-soldiers from uniform to civilian life.

But it is the so-called re-profiling of capital expenditures at the Defence Department that may have the biggest political and policy impact on the Liberal government.
It comes at a time when the Trump administration is leaning on allies, including Canada, to put more into their militaries and meet the NATO spending benchmark of two per cent of gross domestic product.
Morneau was measured in his comments.

​""We are going through, as you know, a defence policy review, the results of which will be out in the not-too-distant future,"" he said at a news conference prior to the release of the budget. ""And that will show our level of ambition ... in making sure that we play our part internationally.""

Federal budget documents are not clear about the reason for the massive reallocation of funds. In fact, there was outright confusion about references to the need to reallocate cash in the future for things like new fixed-wing search-and-rescue planes and upgrades to the army's fleet of LAV III armoured fighting vehicles.
Those programs are already underway and were recently announced by the Liberals.
""That explanation makes no sense,"" Dave Perry, an analyst with the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, told CBC News. ""That whole description is incoherent, so I cannot make heads nor tails of what they are saying.""

Last year's federal budget saw a similar — much smaller — postponement of defence equipment purchases. Federal finance officials who briefed the media said this year's reallocation was on top of the $3.7 billion measure taken last year — an assertion officials in Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan's office had to correct late Wednesday.
At the end of the day, it was still not clear what projects in the already moribund defence procurement system were being postponed and under what circumstances.

Perry's assessment was blistering: ""I'm stunned this budget is actually taking money away from the military and pretending to give it back several decades in the future.""

The budget does contain a modest increase of funding for defence —  $184 million — on the operations side. But that is cash the previous Conservative set aside and the Liberals promised not to touch in the last election campaign.
Perry said the budget, as written, will almost certainly drive Canada's defence spending below one per cent of GDP.
And that is something former Conservative cabinet minister James Moore said will almost certainly incur the wrath of the new administration in Washington.
""Defence policy is just not a priority for this government at all,"" said Moore. ""The Americans are watching this. The Americans notice this. Secretary Mattis, President Trump will be well briefed on all of the partners with the United States in NATO.""

The Liberals have taken pains to build a positive relationship with key players around Trump, and Moore said he believes the political signal sent by this budget on defence will have repercussions in other areas.
""It'll have consequences on the bilateral relationship with the United States in the future, whether it's on trade; whether it's on a border tax,"" he said. ""Prior to any future meeting between President Trump and Prime Minister Trudeau, President Trump will be reminded Canada is not pulling its weight or doing its fair share when it comes to national defence.""

Separately, the government was keen to highlight the improvements it plans to make in terms of support for veterans.
There is more money for education and retraining of ex-soldiers, better career transition services and support for caregivers who look after injured and ill veterans, among other things.
The government was obliged by its accounting rules to book most of the program spending in the current budget year, which is about to end next week.

Potter faced widespread criticism for the article, including from Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard, who said it painted a ""negative portrait"" of the province ""based on prejudices.""
The  described last week's traffic jam on Montreal's Highway 13, which left hundreds of people stranded in their cars overnight during a snow storm, as a ""mass breakdown in the social order.""
In a statement shared on Twitter, Potter said he ""deeply regrets many aspects of the column"" and how it came across as critical of the entire province.

""That wasn't my intention, it doesn't reflect my views of Quebec, and I am heartbroken that the situation has evolved the way it has,"" he wrote.
Potter said ""negative reaction from within the university community and the broader public"" left him no choice but to resign.



Potter took over as director of the institute last August for what was supposed to be a three-year term. He had served as the editor of the Ottawa Citizen before his appointment.
He plans to continue to teach at McGill. Potter's announcement followed a Facebook post on Tuesday in which Potter apologized for the ""rhetorical flourishes"" in the piece. 



The role of the institute, the university said, is to ""develop a clearer understanding of Canada's social, political and economic future; to identify and explore the benefits that a pluralistic society offers and to support the study of Canada across the country and internationally.""


McGill, which refused a request for an interview, has faced criticism of its own for its handling of the controversy.
As Potter's column circulated earlier this week, the university said on Twitter that the views expressed in the column ""do not represent those of McGill.""



That prompted , by academic Emmett Macfarlane, arguing the university had ""lost sight of the core principles by which it ought to [be] governed.
""This may seem, on the surface, a relatively innocuous statement. But it is in fact a reprehensible attack on the core of the academic mission, and specifically on academic freedom,"" he wrote.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/andrew-potter-mcgill-institute-for-the-study-of-canada-resignation-macleans-1.4037618?cmp=rss

Those are just two of several Liberal government moves that will hit pocketbooks directly, though modestly.

The measures include slight increases — pennies, in fact — in tobacco and alcohol taxes.


And on the savings side, the budget ends the long-running Canada Savings Bonds program this year, now recognized as an inefficient way for governments to raise money.

Created in 1946 to replace a war-bonds program, savings bond sales have fallen sharply in recent years as the interest rate earned fell behind the savings rates offered at banks and other private institutions.

The government says it will honour the $5 billion of Canada Savings Bonds that are currently outstanding, but won't sell any more.


The proposed levy on Uber and other ride-hailing services would for the first time impose GST/HST on fares, in the same way they are charged on traditional taxi services. The change will broaden the definition of a taxi business to ensure Uber and other web-based ride-hailing services are required to charge and remit GST/HST, adding to the cost of each trip.

The effect on federal revenues will be modest, just $3 million in additional revenue in 2017-18, but the budget suggests the measure is to help level the playing field and create tax fairness.

The non-refundable public transit tax credit — a so-called boutique tax credit introduced by the previous Conservative government — will be phased out on July 1. The credit enabled public transit users to apply 15 per cent of their eligible expenses on monthly passes and other fares toward reducing the amount of tax they owe. Ending that tax break is expected to save Ottawa more than $200 million a year.

The increases in so-called sin taxes on alcohol and tobacco come into effect Thursday, adding a penny to the price for a litre of wine, for example, and just over two cents to a litre of spirits.

A 24-pack of beer is going up by five cents, and 200 cigarettes will cost another 53 cents.

The higher excise taxes are expected to put $85 million into government coffers in 2017-18.

Foreign tourists will no longer be eligible for a GST/HST rebate on the cost of their accommodations or tour packages. Once phased in next year, the change will add $15 million in sales taxes to the federal treasury.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/federal-budget-2017-uber-bonds-transit-tax-1.4036893?cmp=rss

This year's budget adds a further $3.4 billion over five years for areas of ""critical need,"" in addition to the $8.4 billion pledged in 2016.
""We have made significant investments that we think will make a difference,"" said Finance Bill Morneau in a budget news conference.
Education and skills training are part of that spending, with $219 million allocated over the next five years.
Of that, $90 million will go to the post-secondary student support program over the next two years. The government estimates the money will support the financial needs of more than 4,600 First Nations and Inuit students.

The Liberals' 2015 election campaign promised to add $50 million annually to the program, but the money was left out of the government's first budget last year. The Trudeau government has faced criticism for that omission from Indigenous groups that estimate 10,000 students are on the waiting list for funding to help them advance their education and get training.
Canada's Indigenous population is growing rapidly, with about half under the age of 25.
In addition, the budget will provide $25 million over five years to Indspire, a charity that helps Indigenous students go to post-secondary institutions and find jobs, and another $104 million in development and training, adult education and reducing employment barriers for young people living on reserves.

This year's new money includes $828.2 million for First Nations and Inuit health, with $118.2 million to support mental health programs and $15 million to fight drug addiction.
The budget also sets aside $1.1 billion for ""improving Indigenous communities"" where there's a huge need for adequate housing, better health facilities, new schools and safe drinking water.
So far, 18 long-term drinking water advisories have been lifted in First Nations, with 71 still to go.
The budget promises that all of the remaining long-term advisories will be cleared up by March 2021.
There's also additional money to help northern and remote Indigenous communities switch away from diesel power generation. Diesel fuel is used widely for heat and electrical power in remote communities, but it's expensive and bad for the environment. The budget sets aside $715 million over 11 years, some of it new money, to help communities develop renewable energy or to hook up to existing electricity grids so they can move away from the fuel.

But while the budget pledges to ""further its relationship with Indigenous people"" there is no new money for the First Nations child and family services program.
Last year's budget set aside $634.8 million over five years for that, but the Liberals have come under fire for being too slow to get money out the door to help children and families in need.
Last year, a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled Canada discriminates against First Nations children compared with what other children receive under provincial programs. That tribunal is holding a hearing this week to examine why Ottawa has yet to abide by its decision.
This year's budget document doesn't mention the program.
A spokesperson for Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett said that's because there was no change to the $635 million already allocated in last year's budget that's rolling out as planned.

James Fitz-Morris said in an email to CBC News that the 2016 budget set out how funding for child welfare will increase annually for the next five years, starting with $71.1 million in 2016-17 increasing to $176.8 million a year by 2020-21.
Last July, the department announced an additional $382 million to implement Jordan's principle, to ensure equal access to health care and social services for children over the next three years.
But Cindy Blackstock, head of First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, is disappointed there's no additional money in this budget to more quickly help kids in troubled family situations.
""Nothing in there despite three legal orders for the government of Canada to comply and make sure this generation of First Nations children isn't unnecessarily removed from their families because of Canada's inequitable funding,"" said Blackstock.
""That discrimination continues today.""

Morneau told reporters that sorting out that thorny issue is going to take time.
""You'll see a continuing dialogue, and a continuing focus in our discussions with all those engaged, so we can make sure we have adequate resources that we can actually make the difference we're expected to make,"" Morneau said.
Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde said the budget makes ""important and positive investments"" to help close the socioeconomic gap for First Nations, but he urged the government to move faster to ensure real results on the ground.
""I'll be happy when the gap is finally closed and First Nations enjoy the same quality of life as other Canadians,"" he said. ""First Nations can help this government deliver results because we know better than anyone the needs and priorities for our peoples. We can work together to deliver those results and we have to move now.""
He also welcomed additional resources to support and archive Indigenous languages.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-budget-indigenous-2017-1.4035409?cmp=rss

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced earlier this week it was banning beef and poultry products from JBS and BRF, two of the world's biggest meat companies.
Some other jurisdictions went further: Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Japan and the European Union have banned imports from those producers as well as the other 20 smaller plants implicated in the investigation. On Thursday, China also confirmed a ban after its initial ambiguous measures left hundreds of tons of meat adrift at sea and shipping companies unable to deliver meat or use the country's ports as their transshipment points, as they usually do.

The scandal emerged last Friday after Brazil's national police announced the findings of a two-year investigation involving the meat producers' practices and alleged corruption among some government officials.
The investigators allege that JBS and BRF disguised inedible beef, pork and chicken, bound for both domestic consumption and export, by injecting the meat with chemicals and acids to improve its appearance and smell; by mixing expired meat with healthy meat; and by fleshing out meat that was considered weak with water and low-cost starch, such as manioc flour.
Both companies deny any wrongdoing, while Brazilian politicians downplayed the scandal. Ministry of Agriculture spokesperson Eumar Novacki said at a news conference that consuming meat from these companies posed only ""very small risks"" for consumers, while Brazilian President Michel Temer called the scandal ""a fuss.""

That has done little to reassure the 150 countries that the two companies export to. 
""The reputation of Brazilian beef, and indeed all Brazilian agricultural product, will be tarnished — I have no doubt about that,"" Prof. Chris Elliot, founder of the Institute for Global Food Security, told CBC News. ""For Brazil, being such a large meat-producing country and exporting so much across the world, it seems to be quite remarkable that there's such a widespread fraud going on.""

Investigators say Operation Weak Meat uncovered evidence of bribes paid to Brazilian officials, including some at the federal Ministry of Agriculture, to look the other way. Police issued 38 arrest warrants and closed 21 meat-packing facilities for further inspection.
Brazil's federal Justice Minister, Osmar Serraglio, was allegedly caught on tape calling one of the inspectors under investigation ""big boss"" in a phone conversation with one of the leaders of the bribery scheme in Parana state.
Serraglio, who oversees the investigating police force, said the police raids prove he is not interfering in the inquiry. Police in Brazil said there was insufficient evidence to launch a separate investigation into the minister's involvement. 

Prof. Decio Zylbersztajn, founder of Agribusiness Intelligence Center-PENSA, told CBC News in an email that he was not surprised by the scandal.
""Agribusiness is not more or less involved with corruption than any other sector,"" Zylbersztajn said. ""Opportunism is a reality that must be faced by governments and corporations.""
Brazil exported $5.9 billion worth of poultry and $4.3 billion worth of beef in 2015, with Japan, Russia and the Middle East being its principal customers. JBS and BRF account for a significant percentage of this trade.
Canada imports US $53 million worth of animal products from Brazil every year, according to MIT's , but there's no way of knowing how much Brazilian meat really makes it into Canadian supermarkets because the global supply chain is complicated.

Elliott says tracing a meat product's end destination is trickier than it seems. It is ""absolutely"" possible that the U.S. — which bought US $297.8 million of Brazil's meat in 2016 — processes meat from Brazil and sells it on to Canada.
""One of the most complicated supply chains in the world is red meat, particularly processed red meat,"" said Elliott. ""Food is a true global commodity, and knowing where your food comes from is close to impossible in many cases.""

Brazil relies on agribusiness as a key sector for stability as it struggles to pull itself out of recession. But Prof. Felipe Serigati, of the Sao Paulo School of Economics, told CBC News he doesn't expect the scandal to impact Brazil's economic recovery.
""Although the meat sector is important, the economy isn't going to grow more or shrink because of these events,"" Serigati said. ""There are very few economic sectors that could, in isolated form, destabilize the Brazilian economy,"" said Serigati.
However, Elliott anticipates the scandal will have worldwide consequences, provoking a rise in commodity prices globally. He also believes that similar arrangements — bribing officials to grade unsuitable meat as edible for consumption — will be uncovered in other countries that export large amounts of meat, as importers begin tighter inspections after Brazil's revelation.
""Over the next few weeks, you will see that this scandal will spread,"" he said. ""It's not just Brazil.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/brazil-canada-meat-scandal-1.4038121?cmp=rss

Finance Minister Bill Morneau unveiled the proposed tax in Wednesday's budget.
An executive with Uber's Canadian operations on Thursday called it a ""tax on innovation"" that would hurt Uber drivers and users.

""At a time when Canadians spend far too much time stuck in traffic — and people should be encouraged to leave their cars at home, take public transit, and share rides — we should be supporting policies that make sustainable transportation more affordable, not more expensive,"" said Ian Black, regional general manager for Uber Canada, in a statement.
Morneau's proposed tax on Uber and other ride-hailing services would for the first time impose GST/HST on fares, much like they are added on traditional taxi services. The change will broaden the definition of a taxi business to ensure Uber and other web-based ride-hailing services are required to charge and remit the tax.
The change in the definition of a taxi business will go into effect on July 1.

The change would add just $3 million in additional revenue to Ottawa's coffers in 2017-18, but the federal budget suggests the measure is to help level the playing field and create tax fairness.
Uber disagrees with the government's approach.
""Federal tax laws already offer small business owners a break on collecting sales tax, but unfairly exclude taxi drivers,"" Black said. ""The best way to support taxi drivers and level the playing field is to extend the same exemption to them.""

The Associated Press, which cited two unnamed sources, said Tom Shannon — who is undersecretary in the State Department — will issue the approval tomorrow.
That move would clear the way for the White House to approve the pipeline.
""We'll have an update on that for you tomorrow,"" White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Thursday.
Politico earlier reported that the approval would come by Monday, which is the last day in a 60-day timeline set in motion by U.S. President Donald Trump back in January, when he issued an executive order that invited Calgary-based TransCanada Corp. to reapply for a presidential permit. The order also instructed the U.S. State Department to ""take all actions necessary and appropriate to facilitate its expeditious review."" 

The 1,900-kilometre, 90-centimetre diameter pipeline would bring about 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Hardisty, Alta., through Montana and South Dakota to Steele City, Neb. There it would tie into the existing Keystone pipeline, which carries oil to Illinois and Texas.
""We do anticipate a decision by the State Department during the 60 days they have been given,"" TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha told CBC News in an email statement. ""At the moment, we continue to work with the administration on our presidential permit application.""
Approval from the U.S. government is not the final hurdle for the project. It still needs to win approval in Nebraska. A decision from the Nebraska Public Service Commission is expected in late September, Politico said.
The project also needs approval from landowners in the state.

""All of the approvals are in place north of the 49th parallel [for Keystone XL],"" Carr said Thursday on Parliament Hill. 



Keystone XL was originally rejected by then president Barack Obama, who turned it down in November 2015 saying it ""will not serve the national interests of the United States.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/keystone-approval-us-government-1.4037797?cmp=rss

The theft happened in a ""small number"" of cases when points were used to buy products in stores, says the rewards program.
Air Miles reports that it's now in the early stages of investigating the theft. ""We are working diligently to resolve the situation and have already contacted our retail partners, the police and the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre,"" it said in a  to members.

To protect collectors, Air Miles has temporarily halted the option that allowed members to use their cash miles to buy products at participating retailers, such as gas at Shell, groceries at Sobeys or drug store items at Rexall. Collectors can still use their cash miles to buy gift cards online for participating stores.
Air Miles is also advising members to protect themselves by keeping private both their collector and PIN numbers for their account. 
The program says members' personal information remains protected and has not been compromised as part of the theft.

Rewards expert Patrick Sojka believes the breach was waiting to happen to Air Miles. He says shoppers aren't required to enter a password or PIN number when using their miles towards store purchases. Instead, he says they can opt for automatic check-out, input someone else's account number and buy products.
""I'm surprised this hasn't come about sooner that people have started using peoples' Air Miles numbers to redeem cash rewards,"" says Sojka, of Calgary-based resource site Rewards Canada.
""There's no true way to kind of prove that you're actually the person who's holding that Air Miles account.""
Air Miles says it has protections in place to help customers using cash miles. They include putting a daily cap the amount of instant cash redemptions, alerting members by email when a transaction has been made, and requiring members to use a PIN number when setting up a cash miles account. 
When members collect miles, they can designate them as either dream or cash miles. Dream miles can be used to get rewards like vacations and merchandise. Cash miles are used solely to get products from participating retailers. Typically, 95 reward miles equals $10 off a purchase. 
Air Miles says that the rewards program has more than 11 million active collector accounts. 
In February, Loblaw experienced a similar problem with points theft. 
The grocery store giant  PC Plus rewards collectors to beef up their passwords after points were stolen from some members' accounts.

When asked about possible changes to the way profits from selling off personal assets are taxed in the future, Morneau left the door open Thursday.

""We decided not to put that in our budget,"" Morneau said when asked about the chances of future changes.
Rumours about a possible increase to capital gains taxes were widespread on Bay Street ahead of the budget on Wednesday.

Under the current rules, half of investors' capital gains are included when calculating their income taxes. Speculation had suggested that rate could increase to as much as two-thirds or three-quarters.
Jack Mintz, a tax policy expert at the University of Calgary, said raising taxes on capital gains would hurt innovation.
""If we raised the capital gains tax rate that's just going to encourage more people to look at the American market to start businesses or to develop things down there as opposed to here if that happens,"" he said.
""It's not a very good signal I don't think at this point to start looking at hiking more taxes on investors at this point.""

Ontario Finance Minister Charles Sousa had written to Morneau asking for changes to the taxation of capital gains on the sale of homes that are not classified as a primary residence.
Sousa had wanted an increase as a way to address speculative investors flipping homes in hot housing markets like Toronto and help make it easier for first-time homebuyers.
""It wasn't part of their budget and so we'll have to address it in other ways,"" Sousa said.
Ensuring wealthy Canadians pay their fair share of taxes has been a key issue for the Liberals who raised income taxes on the highest earners in the budget last year and cut taxes for those in the middle.
In the budget this year, the Liberals said the government was reviewing how the rich use private corporations to limit their taxes.

A total of 567,900 people received EI benefits in January, up 3.7 per cent compared to the same month a year earlier. Statistics Canada said the annual increase is ""largely as a result of increases in Alberta.""

On a monthly basis, however, 6.2 per cent fewer Albertans used EI. That's the largest monthly per cent decline in Alberta since April 2012, said Statistics Canada.
The monthly decline in Saskatchewan was 1.9 per cent, and Newfoundland and Labrador saw a 1.1 per cent monthly decline. The highest monthly increase in EI benefits was in Quebec, where 2.8 per cent more Canadians turned to the program. Monthly beneficiaries were up by 1.5 per cent in Manitoba and 1.1 per cent in Prince Edward Island.
Canada's unemployment rate fell to 6.6 per cent in February, when the economy saw a net gain of 15,000 jobs.

Those changes included  for EI and extending the length of EI benefits in certain regions facing increased unemployment, like Alberta, parts of Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador.
""The January decrease in the number of beneficiaries in these provinces may reflect an increase in the number of people who have exhausted their extended benefits,"" said Statistics Canada.
""In Alberta, the January decrease in the number of beneficiaries could also reflect improvements in the local labour market, coinciding with the recent rise in global oil prices, as well as remediation and reconstruction activity in Fort McMurray following the May 2016 wildfires.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/january-2017-employment-insurance-1.4037465?cmp=rss

But a new report suggests an altogether different application: use it as a bargaining chip.
A free-market think tank suggests offering American negotiators in upcoming NAFTA talks more open trade in dairy, in exchange for more stable trade in softwood lumber to secure long-term peace on that perennially problematic file.
Squeezing some protectionism out of both industries would be good for consumers, spur economic productivity, and ultimately result in more successful businesses in both countries, says the report from the Montreal Economic Institute.

""Trade barriers have never made more than a small minority of people richer, at the expense of the vast majority,"" says the paper, released Thursday.
""Eliminating those that persist in the agricultural sectors under supply management and in the softwood lumber sector ... would be good both for consumers and for producers....
""That opportunity should be seized without hesitation.""
Both industries face a critical moment. For dairy, the Trump administration is being pressed to include the issue in NAFTA talks by U.S. lawmakers, just as softwood lumber experiences its latest round of once-a-decade lawsuits and tariff threats.
The industries share similarities.
Both are shielded from open trade in the old NAFTA, employ more than 200,000 people in Canada, and claim a similar economic value of $14-15 billion to Canada's GDP. The paper suggests achieving freer trade in both industries by giving up supply management in dairy.

The current system limits the amount of dairy and poultry Canada can import before a tariff kicks in. Dismantling it would mean lower prices at the supermarket, and a more internationally competitive industry, says the paper.
It points to New Zealand's experience: dairy production nearly tripled after liberalization, and the country became a global player.
But Canada's dairy lobby vigorously disputes the promised benefits.
Dairy Farmers of Canada says supply management's critics get several things wrong — starting with the price of milk. It cites statistics showing Canada in the middle of the international price range on milk, lower than New Zealand and France and higher than the U.S. and Germany.
The system also keeps prices stable, the group notes.

It also says free trade in agriculture would cease to exist if Canada ended supply management. In the U.S. alone, research by the Congressional Budget Office has calculated that country will provide tens of billions in federal support for farm programs over the coming decade.
But the Montreal Economic Institute's paper says the industry could use a jolt.
It says dairy production levels compare to those of the 1960s; that the industry is slow to innovate, and failing to tap the growing international demand for dairy; and that it's being propped up by inflated prices that cost Canadian households $258 a year.
There are two major obstacles to this idea ever happening.
One is that all major Canadian political parties support supply management, which has vocal backing in rural areas, especially in Ontario and Quebec. There was noisy opposition when Canada agreed to merely open the system up a bit in trade deals with Europe and Asia.
The second obstacle: there's no guarantee U.S. negotiators would go for a logs-for-cheese deal.
The idea has old roots.
A senior negotiator from the original 1987 Canada-U.S. free-trade agreement said he would have loved to trade away supply management.

In his memoir on the negotiations, Gordon Ritchie said the dairy system hurts Canadians at grocery stores, protects inefficient producers, and keeps the industry from becoming an international player — like Canada's vineyards did, after liquor trade liberalized.
So what happened?
The Americans never made a big offer, Ritchie says, and Canada held on to its cheese chit.
""We were, regrettably, successful in protecting those (dairy and poultry) restrictions,"" he wrote in his memoir, .
""I for one would welcome the removal of these restrictions,"" he wrote. ""As a negotiator, however, I did not feel the Americans had paid us enough to be entitled to their removal.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/dairy-softwood-nafta-swap-1.4037703?cmp=rss

But a pilots' group says the scheduling practice raises concerns.
Miroslav Gronych pleaded guilty this week to having care and control of an aircraft with a blood alcohol level over .08 after being arrested at the Calgary airport on Dec. 31, 2016.

According to an agreed statement of facts presented in court, Gronych flew into the Calgary airport at 12:48 a.m and was supposed to report back at 6 a.m. for a 7 a.m. flight that was scheduled to make stops in Regina and Winnipeg before continuing on to Cancun, Mexico.
Gronych was scheduled to finish his shift after the plane stopped in Regina.
Federal aviation regulations require that pilots have the opportunity for at least eight hours of sleep prior to reporting for flight duty at the beginning of a shift.
In this case, though, Sunwing said Gronych's duty had begun the previous night and included two separate flights, so the roughly six-hour break between them fell within the rules.
But Greg McConnell with the Canadian Federal Pilots Association (CFPA) said ""split duty"" shifts like these raise concerns about pilot readiness.
""When I saw that … it raised my eyebrows immediately,"" he said of the duration between Gronych's scheduled flight times.
The CFPA represents professional pilots whose duties include aviation inspections, flight testing of pilots, certification of operators and the development of operating standards.

Sunwing declined an interview but, in an email, the company said Gronych's scheduling fell within Transport Canada guidelines.
The shift began when he reported for duty at 10:25 p.m. on Dec. 30 in Winnipeg and flew to Calgary, arriving just before 1 a.m. on Dec. 31.
""Sunwing then arranged a room for him at the Delta Calgary Airport Hotel where he was to wait until his next scheduled flight later that same morning,"" spokesperson Jacqueline Grossman said in the email.
But Gronych was late reporting for the 7 a.m. flight, according to the agreed statement of facts.
At 6:50 a.m., the flight's co-pilot called Sunwing's operations centre, who then contacted Gronych. He said he was lost in the airport and struggling to find the right gate. 
Gronych eventually arrived at the correct gate at 7:05 a.m., court heard, after passengers had already boarded the plane.

At this point the co-pilot observed what he described as obvious signs of impairment — slurred speech, staggering and difficulty in accomplishing simple tasks like hanging up his jacket. He then took Gronych off the aircraft to tell him he wouldn't be flying the plane.
When the co-pilot then called Sunwing's operations centre to update them on the situation, court heard that Gronych then returned to the flight deck, sat in the pilot's chair, and appeared to fall asleep.
He later left the aircraft voluntarily and was arrested by police at 8:08 a.m.
It is against the law for pilots in Canada to have consumed any alcohol within eight hours of flying.
Individual airlines often have even stricter rules, including Sunwing, which Grossman said has a ""a zero tolerance policy"" on any alcohol consumption within 12 hours of duty.

Had Gronych completed his shift, Sunwing said he was scheduled to arrive in Regina at 9:25 a.m., where he would have ended his shift.
He was not scheduled to continue on to Cancun.
""It is important to note that Gronych was continuously on duty throughout the entire 11 hour and 15 minute period, which abides with Transport Canada's guidelines stating that a duty period cannot exceed 14 hours,"" Grossman said.


While in Gronych's case the main concern was the pilot's impairment by alcohol, McConnell said double-flight shifts create the possibility for fatigue-related risks as well.
""In order to be effective, you have to be alert. You have to be aware of your surroundings,"" he said.
""For the same reason you don't want to fall asleep driving your car, you don't want us falling asleep when we're flying the airplane — it's basically that simple.""
Transport Canada declined an interview request.
""As the case of the Sunwing pilot is currently before the courts, it would be inappropriate for Transport Canada to comment,"" a spokesperson said in an email.
 require airlines ensure flight crew members are provided ""the minimum rest period"" prior to reporting for duty.
That minimum rest time is defined as ""a period during which a flight crew member is free from all duties, is not interrupted by the air operator or private operator, and is provided with an opportunity to obtain not less than eight consecutive hours of sleep in suitable accommodation, time to travel to and from that accommodation and time for personal hygiene and meals.""
After pleading guilty to the impaired charge on Tuesday, Gronych immediately began serving a jail sentence. He is due back in Calgary court on April 3 to learn the length of his sentence.
The Crown is recommending a one-year sentence while his defence lawyer is seeking a term of three to six months.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/miroslav-gronych-sunwing-double-flight-shift-1.4036936?cmp=rss

The spreading boycott confronts Google with a challenge that threatens to cost it hundreds of millions of dollars.

YouTube's popularity stems from its massive and eclectic library of video, spanning everything from polished TV clips to raw diatribes posted by people bashing homosexuals.
But that diverse selection periodically allows ads to appear next to videos that marketers find distasteful, despite Google's efforts to prevent it from happening.
Google depends largely on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute.

Earlier this week, Google vowed to step up its efforts to block ads on ""hateful, offensive and derogatory"" videos.
""We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us,"" Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, wrote in a Tuesday blog post.
As part of Google's solution to the problem, Schindler promised to hire ""significant numbers"" of employees to review YouTube videos and flag them as inappropriate for ads. He also predicted YouTube would be able to address advertisers' concerns through Google's recent advancements in artificial intelligence — technology parlance for computers that learn to think like humans.
But that promise so far hasn't appeased AT&amp;T, Verizon Communications and an expanding global list of advertisers that includes Volkswagen, Audi, HSBC Holdings, the Royal Bank of Scotland and L'Oreal.
""We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,"" AT&amp;T said in a statement. ""Until Google can ensure this won't happen again, we are removing our ads from Google's non-search platforms.""

By extending its ban to everything beyond Google's search results, AT&amp;T is also effectively pulling its ads from more than two million other websites that depend on Google to deliver ads to their pages.
In its statement, Verizon said it decided to pull ads from YouTube to protect its website while it investigates the ""weak links"" among its digital advertising partners.
Both AT&amp;T and Verizon may have an ulterior motive to make YouTube look like an untrustworthy spot for marketers because both companies are trying to sell more digital ads in their own networks.
YouTube has become one of the fastest growing parts of Google's ad system, which generated $79 billion US in revenue last year. Google doesn't disclose how much of that came from YouTube ads, but the research firm eMarketer estimated that the video site accounted for $5.6 billion of that amount. EMarketer projected YouTube's advertising will rise 26 per cent this year to $7 billion, but that prediction came before marketers began to suspend their spending.
The YouTube boycott began late last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in videos delving into contentious themes.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/google-youtube-videos-ads-1.4037468?cmp=rss

Spokesman Mel Duvall said in an email to The Canadian Press that cleanup at the site at Cox Hill Creek west of Bragg Creek is progressing well.
But he added the terrain where the leak happened is ""very rocky and difficult.""
The area where the Husky pipeline leaked is popular for hiking, camping and other outdoor recreation.
Duvall said the cleanup is expected to be done in the next few days and then reclamation work will begin.
The leak was reported to Alberta Energy Regulator last Thursday.
""We take every incident seriously and will use what we learn from this incident to further improve our operations,"" Duvall said Wednesday.
""We are undertaking a thorough investigation of the incident.""
A Husky pipeline rupture last July resulted in 225,000 litres of heavy oil mixed with diluent to spill onto the bank of the North Saskatchewan River in Saskatchewan, with about 40 per cent or 90,000 litres reaching the river.
The spill forced the cities of North Battleford, Prince Albert and Melfort to shut their intakes from the river and find other water sources for almost two months, resulting in costs that Husky pledged to cover.

When Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his team of public servants began putting the final touches on his budget a few weeks ago, things could hardly have looked better for the economy.
Oil prices were in recovery, but in no danger of pushing the loonie up enough to discourage Canadian exports.
In fact, exports were looking strong, unemployment was falling. The U.S. economy seemed to be on a roll after the Trump bump sent stocks soaring.

Following President Donald Trump's coherent speech to Congress, business leaders were increasingly convinced that his odd tweets and bluster were only cover for a shrewd economic strategy. 
Now, of course, things don't look quite as good.
Oil has tumbled from above $55 U.S. a barrel to $48. Suddenly everyone is talking about overvalued U.S. markets and struggles ahead for the U.S. economy.

Trump seemed crazy like a fox after his speech to Congress. But following his latest statements, including accusations that former president Barack Obama had tapped Trump's phones, business leaders are beginning to fear it is not like a fox. 

But whether the economy is on a roll or if it is struggling against looming difficulties,  has made it clear this is no time to change the tax laws in favour of equality.
Even before the finance minister presented his budget yesterday afternoon, it had been widely signalled to the media that rumoured increases to capital gains taxes and cuts to large tax perks would not appear in this budget.

The left-leaning Broadbent Institute was among the few to be surprised enough to be annoyed.
""Rather than taking a bite out of the juicy tax loopholes that unfairly benefit the richest Canadians, the Trudeau government has offered up only a few stale crumbs,"" lamented institute executive director Rick Smith.
""Despite significant public attention, and overwhelming support for action, Budget 2017 completely ignores the inequitable tax treatment of stock options, capital gains and dividends, which are only available to the richest Canadians and which — every year — deprive the federal government of billions of dollars that could be spent to improve the lives of Canadians,"" said Smith in a release shortly after the budget.

On the other hand, people who are wealthy or who speak for the wealthy have been firmly against any increase on taxes for the rich.
On budget day itself, even after changes to capital gains seemed unlikely, investment adviser Som Sief made a case against more taxes on the wealthy because "".""
Montreal investor Stephen Jarislowsky said the government needed to """" over the idea of taxing the rich.
""We're trying to rebuild our economy, and I don't think you rebuild the economy by chasing people away who could deliver jobs and build corporations,"" said Jarislowsky.

As the , Morneau has put some of the details of Canada's budget plans on hold partly because of uncertainty about what the Trump administration will do next.
Trump says he will cut taxes for corporations and individuals. The implication is that if Trump does that, Canada may be forced to follow suit to prevent a run for the border by Canadian businesses and rich people.
Research by Stanford University using anonymized documents from the U.S. government shows that a border run is not as likely as some fear. A study of people moving from one state to another because of taxes showed rich people were less likely than others to leave their home state, despite different or changing tax rates.

""The rich are different from the general population,"" says . ""They more often have family responsibilities … that embed them in place. They own businesses that tie them to place. And their elite income itself embeds them in place: millionaires are not searching for economic opportunity — they have found it.""

In other words richer Canadians, often our respected friends and neighbours, are not likely to escape to Trump's polarized and possibly unstable United States for the sake of a few percentage points in taxes.
If taxes were to go up and some rich people left, they could be consigning themselves to greater unhappiness. 
A recent survey showed the  live in places where taxes are high and people feel more equal. Norway came in first. Canada was number 7. The United States was 14th on the list. 
Being equal also makes a country rich and innovative, according to the recent business book 
During and since his election campaign, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeated a commitment to equality.
""The benefits of growth must ... be felt by everyone,"" he tweeted on Labour Day last year.
Many Canadians, including rich ones, agree with him in principle. 
But when it comes to actually doing something, there are always plenty of good reasons why it's impossible just now. This budget is more evidence that there really never is a convenient time to increase equality.

Budget 2017, titled Building a Strong Middle Class, offers targeted investments to tackle what it calls the ""challenge of change."" It offers little new spending, but fleshes out details on where dollars earmarked in last fall's economic update will be spent.
The budget delivers $1.18 billion this year on skills and innovation, nearly half of which has already been announced.


Other targeted programs for new investment range from child care and social housing to training for jobless youth, Indigenous people and other Canadians to adapt to the transforming economy.

But some of that money will not begin to flow for years down the road.

""We will continue to invest in our people, our communities, and our economy while maximizing every dollar and ensuring it is well spent,"" Finance Minister Bill Morneau said in the House of Commons.

His budget speech was delayed more than 30 minutes because of filibustering by the Conservatives over proposed changes to parliamentary procedures.

The female-friendly plan includes measures to support female entrepreneurs, expanded eligibility for tax credits for fertility treatments and new flexibility for Canadians to spread out parental leave from the current 12 months to 18 with reduced payments.


The spending plan also includes some smaller revenue grabs, including a new tax on ride-sharing services like Uber, cancellation of the Canada Savings Bond and new taxes on tobacco products and alcohol. A non-refundable transit tax credit brought in by the previous Conservative government has also been scrapped.


But former Saskatchewan finance minister Janice MacKinnon said the 278-page budget document delays much-needed measures for keeping businesses, jobs and opportunities in Canada in the wake of the election of U.S. President Donald Trump.

""I see this budget as a bit of a pause. It's a pause in the spending, from the big spending last time to virtually no new spending this time, and also a pause because of what is happening in the United States,"" said MacKinnon.

""Donald Trump is there and his message is clear: he's going to help the middle class by reducing taxes, reducing regulations, not proceeding with helping the environment, and we're going in the opposite direction.""


The budget provides more details about the government's previously announced $81.2-billion infrastructure plan, including $11 billion for affordable housing over 11 years and $7 billion over 10 years to create new child-care spaces.

Some of the other key budget details:



The budget offers no timeframe of when the government will balance the books.

The budget predicts the economy will grow slightly this year, keeping the ratio of federal debt to GDP fairly flat for the next five years, at 31.6 per cent in this year compared with 31.5 per cent last year.


Sprinkled through the budget are other spending initiatives, some of which draw on previously announced allocations:


Morneau said in his speech in the Commons that consumer spending is up since the government introduced the Canada child benefit, and the economy has seen the largest seven months of job gains Canada has seen in a decade.

""These are good, early signs of a plan that is working,"" he said.

Interim Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose slammed the budget for ""nickel and diming Canadians to death"" through rescinded credits, new taxes and user fees. She accused government of being out of step with the needs of ordinary Canadians, putting the interests of venture capitalists ahead of family farmers, oil drillers and salon workers.
""If you're a guy who takes the bus to work and back, or to university and back and when you get home you like to have a beer, well both of those things are going to cost you more,"" she said.
Ambrose said the budget also misses an opportunity to take steps to combat Trump's ""aggressive"" move to cut taxes for individuals and businesses.


The government had floated several trial balloons in the run-up to the budget, including proposals to tax capital gains and privatize federally owned airports, which were left out of the budget.
NDP Leader Tom Mulcair said if the government had closed a stock option tax loophole it could have netted $720 million that could have helped children living on First Nations reserves.
He also criticized the government or delaying the roll-out of new money for critical programs.
""There is not one penny for child care next year,"" he said. ""The lack of affordable quality child care is one of the things that affects women negatively in terms of their economic livelihood. It's a shame the Liberals have not made that a priority despite all their promises.""



The budget creates Innovation Canada, with $950 million over five years to support innovators and build hubs for innovation known as ""super-clusters.""

Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at the CIBC, said government can only do so much to prepare for the digital economy; education systems and the private sector must do the heavy lifting.

Shenfeld said it's positive that the government is recognizing the nature of work is changing, but whether the measures to spur innovation announced today will have a positive impact is to be determined.

""These are always experiments, because it's like every government introduces new skills training programs and we have to wait and see how they work,"" he said.

""But at least they're not creating big boondoggles where corporations apply for money … thinking that is going to push innovation. Clearly people who can fill these jobs is a big part of it.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-trudeau-morneau-budget-2017-1.4034793?cmp=rss

Those are just two of several Liberal government moves that will hit pocketbooks directly, though modestly.

The measures include slight increases — pennies, in fact — in tobacco and alcohol taxes.


And on the savings side, the budget ends the long-running Canada Savings Bonds program this year, now recognized as an inefficient way for governments to raise money.

Created in 1946 to replace a war-bonds program, savings bond sales have fallen sharply in recent years as the interest rate earned fell behind the savings rates offered at banks and other private institutions.

The government says it will honour the $5 billion of Canada Savings Bonds that are currently outstanding, but won't sell any more.


The proposed levy on Uber and other ride-hailing services would for the first time impose GST/HST on fares, in the same way they are charged on traditional taxi services. The change will broaden the definition of a taxi business to ensure Uber and other web-based ride-hailing services are required to charge and remit GST/HST, adding to the cost of each trip.

The effect on federal revenues will be modest, just $3 million in additional revenue in 2017-18, but the budget suggests the measure is to help level the playing field and create tax fairness.

The non-refundable public transit tax credit — a so-called boutique tax credit introduced by the previous Conservative government — will be phased out on July 1. The credit enabled public transit users to apply 15 per cent of their eligible expenses on monthly passes and other fares toward reducing the amount of tax they owe. Ending that tax break is expected to save Ottawa more than $200 million a year.

The increases in so-called sin taxes on alcohol and tobacco come into effect Thursday, adding a penny to the price for a litre of wine, for example, and just over two cents to a litre of spirits.

A 24-pack of beer is going up by five cents, and 200 cigarettes will cost another 53 cents.

The higher excise taxes are expected to put $85 million into government coffers in 2017-18.

As , the two media conglomerates are asking business subscribers across Canada to pay an additional levy — which varies depending on the size of the bar — on top of their existing cable bill for the rights to air sports channels that broadcast live sporting events, such as TSN, RDS and Sportsnet.

""New sports packages for business TV clients with a liquor licence will be introduced as of May 1,"" Bell said in a statement to CBC News. ""Prices vary depending on the size of the business and other factors such as the specific sports package a business client wants.""
""We've heard that the average restaurant that's licensed for about 150 patrons, their increase will be $350 to $400 a month,"" said James Rilett, Restaurants Canada's vice-president for Ontario — and those are costs that may well get passed on to bar patrons either directly or indirectly.
""Most restaurants run around about a three per cent profit margin, so that's going to have a pretty big effect, if you have to make up that cost every month. It may affect menu prices or they might just have to take less profit, but there will definitely be an effect.""

Amid a , televised sports remain content that broadcasters are banking on consumers' willingness to pay for. And that strategy extends to bars, where the content providers are now asking bars to pay more for a service they are benefiting from.

""Live sports programming attracts big audiences to public viewing establishments, such as bars and restaurants,"" Rogers-owned Sportsnet told CBC News in a statement. ""For many years, these venues have paid rates for sports content that were not reflective of the benefits they've enjoyed, due to the high volume of patrons that gather to watch sports and the revenue it generates for these establishments.""
""Our new commercial package aligns with the value sports services bring to these establishments,"" Sportsnet said, without elaborating on the size of the fee that will soon be levied.
Bell echoes that view, telling its affected subscribers recently that ""we believe that sports programming is a powerful attractor for bar and restaurant patrons, and that the investment to continue to receive these channels is a good business decision for most establishments.""

""The new rates are designed to more accurately reflect the commercial use of the sports channels and the value that these channels represent to commercial establishments,"" Bell said.
If a current commercial customer with a liquor licence doesn't sign up for the new package, their existing cable service will remain in place for the same price they are already paying, Bell said, but they won't have access to the most popular live sports channels such as the ones listed above.

Data compiled by the realtor in Canada's four largest real estate markets predicts little deviation from ongoing trends.
Toronto is expected to continue to lead the pack in sales of homes worth over $1 million, while Vancouver's high-end home sales will continue to normalize. Calgary's market is forecast to continue its cautious recovery from the oil price shock and sales in Montreal are anticipated to grow modestly, according to the report.

But recent policy changes from federal, provincial and municipal governments remain ""wild cards,"" said Brad Henderson, president and CEO of Sotheby's International Realty Canada.
Last fall, Ottawa introduced new rules requiring all insured mortgages to undergo stress testing to determine if borrowers would still be able to meet their mortgage obligations if interest rates climb or if their incomes decline. Such tests previously were not needed for fixed-rate mortgages longer than five years.

Also last year, the B.C. government introduced a 15 per cent tax on foreign buyers of Vancouver homes and the city of Vancouver imposed a tax on vacant homes.
""We are forecasting that we are going to continue to see the market adjust to this new reality,"" Henderson said of Vancouver.
Sales of homes for over $1 million in Vancouver fell to 531 units in January and February of this year, down 45 per cent from a year ago, Sotheby's said.
The luxury segment of the Vancouver market — defined as homes worth over $4 million — was even more dramatically affected, plunging 68 per cent from a year ago to 43 units, according to the report.

Many owners of top-tier Vancouver homes who were planning to sell are now sitting on the sidelines, Henderson said.
""The individuals involved have less pressure to sell the properties, so they can afford to take a wait-and-see attitude,"" Henderson said. ""Arguably some of those properties would be the target of foreign buyers.""
In Ontario, the provincial government has begun to mull increased regulations to temper house price growth, with Finance Minister Charles Sousa floating several ideas in recent weeks, including a foreign buyer tax and an increase in capital gains tax aimed at curbing speculation.
Sales of homes worth over $1 million increased by 87 per cent across the Greater Toronto region to 3,043 units in the first two months of the year compared to the same period last year, Sotheby's said.

In Toronto proper, sales of $1 million-plus homes rose 44 per cent year-over-year to 943 units, while sales of homes worth over $4 million were up 147 per cent from a year ago to 42 properties.
Henderson predicts that strength will continue in the spring buying season — provided that the government doesn't implement new policies aimed at the real estate sector.
""We feel that the market is the best arbiter of supply and demand, and that government policies often have too many unintended consequences,"" Henderson said.

""They need to be done thoughtfully, not as a reaction to what has really become a very political issue.""
Montreal saw sales of $1 million-plus homes climb 13 per cent year-over-year in the first two months of 2017 to 99 properties. In Calgary, sales of high-end homes were flat in January and February, with 64 properties changing hands.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/sotheby-s-housing-prices-1.4036228?cmp=rss

In a statement to CBC News, Enbridge said the cuts are taking place across the combined company, which had a workforce of roughly 17,000 prior to the announcement of the job cuts.
""After a careful evaluation, Enbridge has taken the difficult but necessary step to address the overlap in the combined company's organizational structure,"" Enbridge spokesperson Todd Nogier said in a release.
""These workforce reductions are only one component of the synergies we expect to achieve over the coming months as we fully integrate our companies,"" Nogier said.
A source familiar with the story said half of the cuts are vacancies and the majority of employee layoffs are taking place in Houston, where Spectra Energy was headquartered.
Shares of Enbridge gained 1.8 per cent on the TSX, rising 98 cents to close at $55.10.

The Enbridge takeover of Spectra was unveiled in September 2016. At the time, the all-stock deal was valued at $37 billion. Enbridge said then that it expected to achieve about $540 million in annualized operational savings, most of it to be achieved in the latter part of 2018.
Enbridge said in late February, just days prior to the completion of the takeover, that the merged company would be the largest energy infrastructure company in North America. Spectra owned natural gas and oil pipelines and storage facilities in both Canada and the United States.

The disclosure raised concerns over the retailer's ability to restructure its debt load and stock inventory heading into the crucial 2017 holiday season.
The drop in the stock, down at $7.72 in early afternoon trade, is the largest one-day percentage decline since a 18.79 per cent tumble on Nov. 16, 2012.
""While I don't think the new disclosure means they will definitely file BK in 2017, it does seem to signal that the next 12 months are even more crucial than has been the case in recent years, as their margin of error is getting slim,"" said Chad Brand, president of Peridot Capital Management, a Sears bondholder.
BK is a shorthand for bankruptcy - a prospect raised after Sears flagged doubts about its ability to stay in business in the ""risk factors"" section of its annual report.
""Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company's ability to continue as a going concern,"" Sears said in the report.
Sears spokesman Howard Reif said the company hopes the actions it is taking will keep it in business.
The company, which has $13.19 billion US in liabilities, noted that it could have difficulty procuring merchandise from vendors. Bondholders are watching to see whether the company will have the cash and credit needed to stock its shelves for the 2017 holiday season.
Retailers typically book orders for merchandise for the vital fourth quarter from now through mid-summer.

Continued operating losses also could restrict access to new funds under its domestic credit agreement, according to the filing.
""Sears has repeatedly engaged in wishful thinking in earnings release after earnings release over the last several years that they could turn the business around,"" said Ken Perkins, president of industry research firm Retail Metrics.
""In today's highly competitive retail environment, which requires sizeable investments to compete with Amazon and off-price chains they no longer have the resources to do so.""
Sears, which lost $2.22 billion US in the year ended Jan. 28, has $286 million US in cash on hand.
Retailers in distress often use their accounts receivable. Sears has $466 million in receivables, down substantially from 2012, when the company had $635 million US in receivables and $609 million US in cash.
Since 2012, Sears accumulated $10.54 billion US in losses while revenue fell 47 per cent to $22.1 billion US.
During that time, Sears cut the number of its U.S. stores by nearly a third,, and spun off the Lands' End clothing chain.

In recent years, Sears has placed some of its stores into a real estate investment trust (REIT), sold its Craftsman line of tools, and repeatedly raised debt from billionaire chief executive Edward Lampert's hedge fund.

Lampert owned nearly 10 per cent of the REIT that paid Sears $2.6 billion US in 2015 for the stores it purchased, many of which were then leased back to the retailer.
The announcement of Sears' potential demise is a blow to Lampert, a hedge fund investor who took control of Sears after merging it with Kmart, which he controlled, in 2004.
He soon published a 15-page manifesto, in which he stated that conventional measures of retail success, such as same-store sales, were no longer relevant. Sears would regain its health by closing struggling stores and focusing instead on profitable sales, he wrote.
Sears last turned an annual profit in 2011.
The company said on Tuesday actions taken during the year to boost liquidity, including the $900 million US sale of the Craftsman tool brand to power tool maker Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc early this year, could satisfy its capital needs for the current fiscal year.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/sears-holdings-doubt-1.4036251?cmp=rss
71547dbd98bfdadb0c36fb0d8df03498482bddcc,Nick Murray,2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,'She was my only girl': Nunavut teen's death sheds light on failures in fighting TB,"Matthew Kilabuk walks into the Inns North hotel in Qikiqtarjuaq, Nunavut, and begins blowing on his hands to warm them up. It is -30 C outside, without wind chill.
Kilabuk, a well-known local artist who's trying to sell some of his drawings, is wearing mitts but the sheepskin is tattered and thin. When asked why he doesn't have a better pair of mitts, he shakes his head.
""My daughter made these for me before she died,"" he replies.
Ileen Kooneeliusie was 15 years old when she died in January from tuberculosis.

In December, Kooneeliusie's mother, Geela, brought Ileen to the local health centre after she complained of headaches and shortness of breath. She was eventually flown to a hospital in Ottawa.
Despite the staggeringly high rate of tuberculosis in Nunavut — 26 times the national average — Geela says Ileen was only diagnosed with TB a few hours before her death.
""My daughter was a happy girl and she was always welcoming to people; she used to like hanging out with her friends,"" Geela says in Inuktitut.
""She was my only girl.""

The case of Ileen Kooneeliusie raises questions about how a person living in a territory with a high incidence of tuberculosis could not be diagnosed in time to save her life.
Last month, , particularly when it came to language barriers with Inuit patients. But one TB expert in Toronto says the questions in this case extend beyond the care Kooneeliusie received in Nunavut.
""The World Health Organization runs programs all over the world in very poor countries,"" says Dr. Michael Gardam, the medical director of the tuberculosis clinic at Toronto Western Hospital.
""There's no reason why we should having a problem managing tuberculosis in Canada.""


In 2015, the TB rate among Inuit was 166.2 per 100,000 — 270 times higher than the rate in the Canadian-born non-Indigenous population, according to a report this month from the Public Health Agency of Canada.
Since January, there have already been 21 new cases of TB diagnosed across Nunavut. Twenty-five per cent of all of Nunavut's reported TB cases in 2015 were among children and youth younger than 24 years old.

Qikiqtarjuaq, which has a population of about 600, is one Nunavut hamlet that is actually equipped with a TB nurse. The Nunavut Department of Health says not all communities have them, but staffing is adjusted depending on TB activity within the community.
While the department wouldn't reveal how many of the 21 cases so far this year arose from Qikiqtarjuaq, it says 13 of those cases are in the Qikiqtaaluk region – which was also home to more than 90 per cent of Nunavut's TB cases between 2007 and 2014.

Geela Kooneeliusie says Ileen's symptoms began with headaches as far back as two years ago. She says Ileen had shortness of breath, too, but nurses in Qikiqtarjuaq diagnosed it as panic attacks.
In the week leading up to her birthday on Dec. 22, 2016, Ileen got worse.
""She was coughing a lot more than usual,"" Geela says.
""She would hang out with her friends, but then came home not long after because of her shortness of breath. She started being scared.""
Geela took Ileen to the health centre three days before her 15th birthday. Geela says nurses put Ileen on intravenous therapy and called for a medevac flight. But the flight was cancelled – the family still doesn't know why – and Ileen was sent home with Tylenol and Motrin.
In the following days, Ileen's condition worsened. Geela says she took her daughter to the health centre again — and again they were sent home.
Ileen continued to deteriorate. She lost control of her bladder and bowels and couldn't walk.
""She could barely do anything. She couldn't go to the washroom and she crawled to get around because she couldn't walk,"" Geela says.
""She was scared for herself.""

On Dec. 27, Ileen was medevaced to Iqaluit. She had a chest X-ray and Geela says doctors diagnosed her daughter as having pneumonia. She was put on a breathing tube and flown to Ottawa.
Doctors at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) treated Ileen for pneumonia, though it's unclear if they made their own diagnosis or worked off information from doctors in Iqaluit.
Dr. Gardam says the symptoms for TB and other causes of pneumonia are similar but there were ""red flags"" in Ileen's case.
""The big difference between tuberculosis and other causes of pneumonia is that most bacterial and viral causes come on quite quickly. Tuberculosis tends to come on much slower,"" he says.
""The big clues [in this case] would be the fact that if whatever lung symptoms she had weren't getting better after several weeks, that's certainly a red flag. Then her having difficulty, suggesting she had something going on in her spine or in her brain, would be an even bigger red flag.""

As Ileen lay in the ICU in Ottawa, her organs shut down, one by one. Geela remembers her daughter going blind and having seizures.
On Jan. 14, doctors pulled Ileen's family aside.
""By around 7 p.m., the bosses came to meet with us,"" Geela says.
""They told us that they tested her lung and took some liquid out. That's when they found out it was active TB. And within the same night, when they found out, she died.""
By the time doctors realized Ileen was fighting tuberculosis, Geela says the disease had spread to both lungs and to her brain.
""After they found out that it was TB, they realized that all those headaches, those pains, were all coming from TB. They also found out that TB caused some of her brain cells to explode. That's what we understand.""


According to the Public Health Agency of Canada report, eight per cent of people with TB in Canada in 2014 died during treatment.
""People certainly still die of tuberculosis in Canada,"" says Dr. Gardam.
""I think one of the main reasons for that is less about the treatment and more about often people don't get diagnosed quickly enough.""
In its Inuit-Specific Tuberculosis Strategy, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami cite overcrowded housing, lack of food security and barriers to accessing health care, such as geography and language, as factors in the high rate of TB among Inuit.
Geela and Ileen's father, Matthew Kilabuk, believe these issues are real.
""We should all be working together but the health centres are just playing with people's lives, especially Inuit,"" Geela says.
""I want to see people getting the help they need.""


The Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario has launched an investigation into Ileen's death. Not only is it looking into the level of care given to her in Ontario but it's working with Nunavut's chief coroner to examine what happened in Nunavut.
Nunavut's Department of Health declined CBC's interview request but in a statement, Health Minister George Hickes said the government is conducting an internal review – formally called a ""Quality Improvement Review.""
Hickes also said Ileen's death is being reported as a ""critical incident"" under the department's Community Health Nurse Administration Manual.
CHEO says it can't address specific cases due to privacy issues but that every death at the hospital is reviewed with the aim of improving care, and that it co-operates fully with coroner's investigations.

Back in Qikiqtarjuaq, much of Ileen's belongings have been packed away. Her artwork is stored and her bedroom is bare, except for the names of friends that she had written on her walls.
Asked what needs to happen to prevent another death like Ileen's, her mother says the health centres need Inuit staff who speak Inuktitut.
""Inuit have a better understanding of the Inuit lives,"" Geela says.
""The job of the health centre is to help people. When we are trying to get help from them they don't believe in what we're saying.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/tb-nunavut-teen-death-ileen-kooneeliusie-1.4036205?cmp=rss

Officers say they came to that conclusion after parsing records obtained from long-term care homes in Woodstock, Paris and London where Wettlaufer worked between 2007 and 2016, often as the nurse in charge on the night shift.
""It was confirmed that Beth Wettlaufer had direct care of each of the victims ... at or just prior to the time of their deaths,"" says the police filing, a sworn statement investigators submitted to a judge in October to get a court order to obtain her education records.
Sections of the  offer a glimpse of how officers looking into Wettlaufer arrived at the decision to charge her with eight counts of first-degree murder, in an investigation that has largely remained cloaked in mystery and innuendo.



New snippets of the document, which contains unproven allegations yet to be tested in court, were made public Thursday morning following an Ontario Superior Court judge's ruling. The Postmedia newspaper chain had been fighting to get the entire file unsealed.  

The newly released portions show police homed in on ""insulin overdose"" as a possible cause in the deaths of the eight seniors early in their investigation, questioning managers at two nursing homes where Wettlaufer worked about how they stored and tracked the medicine.


A manager at Caressant Care in Woodstock, where Wettlaufer was employed from 2007 to 2014 and where it's alleged she killed seven seniors, said the nursing home doesn't secure or monitor its stocks of insulin.

She added that it would ""never be looked at as a cause of death"" in a patient, according to a summary of her remarks revealed in the police statement.

Another nursing home, Telfer Place in Paris, told investigators it doesn't track or control insulin either, the police statement says.



Wettlaufer was fired from Caressant Care on March 31, 2014, but the police filing says she had been suspended four times before that for ""medication-related errors.""

Quoted portions of a dismissal letter from Wettlaufer's boss, Brenda Van Quaethem, say she was terminated because of a ""serious"" incident where she gave the wrong medication to an elderly patient.

""Although you have acknowledged this latest error, this is another incident in a pattern of behaviours that are placing residents at risk,"" Van Quaethem is quoted as writing.


""You have an extensive disciplinary record for medication-related errors, which includes numerous warnings as well as one-, three- and two five-day suspensions.""

The newly uncensored police material suggests Wettlaufer struggled to hold down jobs after that.

In April 2016, she was ""asked not to return"" to one nursing home because of ""her behaviour towards other staff members,"" the police document alleges.



Then in August, she quit a job at a home-care agency and sent an email stating she ""can no longer function as a registered nurse,"" the allegations say.

CBC's has learned Wettlaufer told a pair of acquaintances she was dismissed from two other jobs as well — one because she got caught stealing medication and another because she was high at work one day and gave a patient the wrong medicine.


Wettlaufer faces 14 criminal counts: the eight charges of first-degree murder involving seniors at Caressant Care in Woodstock and Meadow Park long-term care in London, four of attempted murder involving four other patients, and two of aggravated assault against two sisters who lived at Caressant Care.

The murder charges drove headlines around the world when they were announced Oct. 25.
None of the allegations have been tested in court and Wettlaufer has yet to enter a plea. If convicted of the murder charges, she would be one of Canada's worst serial killers.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/elizabeth-wettlaufer-police-allegations-1.4038003?cmp=rss

TB kills more people each year than any other infectious disease, including HIV and AIDS. In 2015 alone, it is estimated to have killed 1.8 million people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
While some new antibiotics with the potential to treat some drug-resistant strains are becoming available for the first time, experts who conducted a global study said that without accurate diagnostics, better case tracking and clear treatment guidelines, their effectiveness could rapidly be lost.

""Resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs is a global problem that threatens to derail efforts to eradicate the disease,"" said Keertan Dheda, a University of Cape Town professor who co-led research published in the  journal.
""Cure rates for drug resistant TB are poor and people can remain infectious.""

TB is a bacterial infection normally treated with a combination of antibiotics. But extensive overuse of antibiotics worldwide has led to a rise in drug-resistant ""superbug"" strains. Bacteria can acquire many drug resistance traits over time, making several types of antibiotics ineffective.
Some 1 in 5 cases of TB are now resistant to at least one major anti-TB drug, the researchers found.
Around 1 in 20 are classed as multidrug-resistant (MDR) — meaning they are resistant to two essential first-line TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin — or extensively drug-resistant — meaning they are also resistant to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs.
Approximately half of global cases of MDR-TB are in India, China, and Russia. Migration and international travel have allowed these highly drug-resistant strains to emerge in almost every part of the world.
In a commentary on TB in the same journal, David W Dowdy, a specialist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the United States, warned that over the next decade, ""it is quite possible that we will see a drug-resistant tuberculosis epidemic of unprecedented global scale."" 
He added, however, that it might also be possible for the global health community to bring about ""an unprecedented reversal"" of the drug-resistant TB problem.
""The difference between these two outcomes lies less with the pathogen and more with … whether we have the political will to prioritize,"" he said. ""Drug-resistant TB is not standing still; neither can we.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/tb-resistance-1.4037555?cmp=rss
c87b3bac3cef0fc6f6f43f0b74f93948c9f3460f,Elizabeth Thompson,2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,"Tax credit for fertility treatments expanded, made retroactive for 10 years","Many Canadians who have turned to assisted reproductive technologies over the past 10 years are now eligible for a tax break as a result of Finance Minister Bill Morneau's new budget.
Getting medical help to conceive a child can cost thousands of dollars, a cost that isn't covered by most provincial health plans.
The government estimates that one in eight Canadian couples experience infertility and ""an increasing number of Canadians, including single parents and same-sex couples, are turning to assisted human reproduction procedures to help build their families.""
Until now, Canadians had to be diagnosed as medically infertile to be able to claim the cost of reproductive technologies as part of their medical expense tax credit.

The change in Wednesday's budget opens the tax credit to those who aren't infertile, such as single women who want to have a child or a same-sex couple who want to start a family.

Moreover, the way the government has decided to proceed means the measure will also effectively be retroactive. By framing it as a clarification of the tax laws, it means that anyone who has incurred expenses over the past 10 years for reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization can refile their taxes for that year and claim the expense.

The government says it could eventually make the expenses associated with turning to a surrogate mother eligible as well, but wants to first wait for the results of a consultation launched by Health Canada to determine which expenses should be considered eligible.
Government officials say they have no idea how much the measure will cost. They say they don't know of cases where someone's expense was denied, but they also don't know if people didn't claim the expense because they weren't medically infertile and didn't believe they were eligible.
Dr. Jeff Roberts, president of the Canadian Fertility and Andrology Society, says an estimated 10,000 people turn to assisted human reproduction technologies in Canada each year, roughly 80 per cent of whom have been trying to conceive for at least a year and meet the definition of infertility.

Most provinces do not cover the costs of in vitro and other fertility treatments, so tax breaks make a big difference for those seeking treatment, he said. A single cycle of IVF can cost between $10,000 and $15,000.
""Anything is a help, because I see patients all day long who need treatments like IVF and just simply can't afford them.""


However, Aaron Wudrick of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation questioned the wisdom of allowing people to retroactively claim the expense.
""Anytime you go retroactively, you're opening up Pandora's box. I think that's probably not a good idea, especially if they have absolutely no estimate of what the cost would be,"" he said.

""If you're going to implement such a measure, it should be forward looking. If you're going to even think about something being retroactive, they have to have some cost estimate. Otherwise they are opening themselves up to considerable fiscal abuse there.""
Allowing an expense to be claimed retroactively also runs counter to the purpose of tax credits, said Wudrick.
""These credits are supposed to help people who might not otherwise be able to do something. If they are already doing it, doing it anyway, and you're just giving them a windfall, you're not really achieving the objective of the credit.""

Former Conservative cabinet minister James Moore said it was unusual for a government to allow people to claim expenses that have been made years ago.
""It's pretty rare to have a 10-year window, a retroactive window going back, for expenses that have already occurred,"" he said.
""So, I think what that signals is that the government doesn't expect this to be a big ticket item in terms of the costs that have been incurred so far.""

With women waiting until they are older to start families, the measure is a reasonable one, said Moore. He dismissed possible objections by those who may not support tax help for same-sex couples to have children.
""I suppose they are free to express their views, but in this country the charter of rights is very clear — all Canadians are treated equally under the law, and we don't discriminate in the tax code based on your sexual preference. If people want to start a family, they are entitled to start a family and the tax credit would apply equally to all Canadians.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/budget-fertility-tax-deduction-1.4037046?cmp=rss
efcd58b1559cbd0f82d08356edadff996f8f2a0e,The Associated Press,2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,"Rare cancer linked to deaths with textured breast implants, FDA says","Nine deaths from a very rare kind of cancer have been linked to breast implants, indicating a very low but increased risk in women with implants, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The FDA said it now agrees with the World Health Organization, which concluded years ago this type of lymphoma can develop following breast implants. Concerns were first raised at the FDA in 2011, but the agency said then that there were too few cases to know if there was a connection.
In an update on Tuesday, the agency said it had received 359 reports of the cancer in women with breast implants, but cautioned that such reports are often missing key details, unconfirmed or duplicated.
The FDA and doctor groups said women who have implants shouldn't panic, and there is no need to have their implants removed. Women should continue with their routine follow-up, but contact their doctor if they have lingering pain or swelling around the implant, particularly years after the surgery.
The cancer is not breast cancer, the FDA emphasized. It is called breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma and mostly occurs in a capsule of tissue that develops around the implant. This type of cancer usually progresses slowly and most patients are readily treated with surgery to remove the implant.
On average, the cancer occurs eight years after a woman gets an implant, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. It noted only about 10 new cases are reported worldwide each year.
In most cases, the cancer was found during surgery to remove or replace an implant after the women reported pain, lumps and swelling around it. That seems to occur more often with textured implants — rather than ones with a smooth surface — but many reports didn't include that information, the FDA said.
The reports also often omitted the type of implant. In those reports that did, about 60 per cent of the cases involved silicone gel implants and the rest saline, according to the FDA.
Since 2011, packaging for all implants sold in the U.S. and Canada has listed the possible cancer risk, and advises women to discuss all the risks and options with their doctor.

s website also notes breast implants have been associated with this form of lymphoma, known as anaplastic large cell lymphoma.
The FDA said it's difficult to give an exact number of cases because of a lack of world-wide reporting and global implant sales data. ",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/breast-implants-1.4035950?cmp=rss

The Canadian Community Health Survey, released Wednesday, found 17.7 per cent of Canadians aged 12 and older — or roughly 5.3 million people — smoked either daily or occasionally in 2015, down slightly from 18.1 per cent a year earlier.
The Statistics Canada survey showed the proportion of people who smoked daily or occasionally was higher among males at 20.4 per cent, compared to 15 per cent of females.

Smoking rates have steadily been falling in Canada. In 2000-01, 26 per cent of respondents to the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) reported using tobacco.
""These decreases in smoking prevalence are encouraging, but an enormous amount of work remains to be done,"" said Rob Cunningham, senior policy analyst at the Canadian Cancer Society, which is advocating that Health Canada mandate plain packaging for cigarettes and related products in its future tobacco control strategy.
Smoking is a known risk factor for lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, chronic respiratory disease, and other health conditions.
In 2015, 12.6 per cent of the population aged 12 and older — about 3.8 million people — reported smoking daily, down from 13.5 per cent the previous year.



Males aged 20 to 34 made up the largest proportion of tobacco users, with more than one in four reporting that they smoked.
Tobacco use was least common among youth aged 12 to 17, with about four per cent reporting they smoked in 2015, followed by adults 65 or older, at almost 10 per cent.
Of the non-smokers, almost 45 per cent were lifetime abstainers, while about one in five were former daily smokers.
People typically begin smoking during their teenage years, so the percentage who have not started smoking by age 20 is an indicator of future smoking rates, Statistics Canada said.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/canada-s-smoking-rate-falls-slightly-1.4036492?cmp=rss
f9fff1b41a6aa686ca7e5d5362b361bc8006667d,Laura Fraser,2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,Prostate cancer patients report that surgery offers worst outcome on quality of life,"At the moment a man hears a diagnosis of prostate cancer, his first thought is often of survival.
It's later — sometimes after treatment — that the patient considers the cost medical intervention can have on his sexual and mental well-being, said Prof. Gabriela Ilie, who is conducting research on quality of life for prostate cancer patients.
""At first the idea is, 'Do I want to survive, or do I want to have sexual function?'"" the Dalhousie University scientist said. ""Once that's settled, they become increasingly concerned about [the latter] following treatment.""
But two other studies published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association explore the consequences of such decisions, by getting patients to rank their quality of life — defined as sexual, urinary and bowel function — in the two to three years following treatment.

Both studies found that patients who chose a radical prostatectomy — the complete removal of the prostate gland — suffered the most significant drop in their quality of life, particularly related to sexual function.
Those who opted for active surveillance, the most conservative approach and one pioneered in Toronto, identified as having the best quality of life at three months and one year compared with all of their counterparts.
But at two years post-treatment, the results were about the same as those who underwent targeted radiation therapy, or brachytherapy, in which radioactive seeds are placed inside the tumour to target cancer cells and reduce damage to surrounding healthy tissue.

Active surveillance essentially monitors a tumour's growth.
Between 25 and 40 per cent of patients in Canada are candidates for that at diagnosis, said Dr. Neil Fleshner, a professor and chair within the University of Toronto's urology department. As the disease progresses, they may need more aggressive treatment.
But the uro-oncologic surgeon at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre also noted the number of men who qualify for active surveillance has been dropping, which he blamed on changes to screening guidelines.

In 2014, a federal task force recommended that men younger than 55 should no longer take the prostate-specific antigen test — because both age and a prostate infection can elevate those levels, prompting unnecessary screening.
But Fleshner said that's resulted in tumours being discovered at a later stage, an argument he also brought up at the time of the task force's findings.

Both JAMA studies focused exclusively on American prostate cancer patients, where it's more common than in Canada to operate on a tumour, Fleshner said. The two-year study looked at roughly 1,150 patients, all of whom chose their own treatment option — something that the specialist noted can create a bias.
He also argued that the analysis lacks a critical component for those making decisions either here or in the U.S.: it doesn't compare the long-term survival rates.

The authors looked at quality of life at three months, one year and two years post-treatment, and acknowledged that missing piece limits their findings.

There's minimal research on the long-term survival rates. 
""The comparative effectiveness of contemporary treatment options for localized prostate cancer is a top research priority according to the National Academy of Medicine,"" one of the JAMA studies noted.
There was, however, a major study published in 2016 that found men diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer who monitored their tumour's growth had the same 10-year survival rates as those who underwent surgery or radiation.

Ilie said she's encouraged by the JAMA study's findings and the fact that others are studying the effect these treatments have on a man's quality of life.
The health researcher, however, said she would like to see someone follow patients for at least 10 years after treatment — and to ask questions about their mental well-being as well as their physical functions.
She's currently creating a framework for clinicians to follow up on these issues.
""We are sexual beings, we are beings with emotional states that vary,"" she said. ""And yet, we don't know how we respond to this type of catalyst.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/prostate-cancer-treatment-1.4035330?cmp=rss

But researchers at the University of Oxford in the U.K.  a computer program called Watch, Attend and Spell to do just that.



They claim their lip-reading algorithm is more accurate than human professionals.
Dan Misener is our tech columnist.


There are a number of reasons you might want a computer to lip-read and many of those have to do with accessibility.
For instance, a lip-reading computer could transcribe or add captions to video, make it easier for people to talk to their devices in noisy environments, or fill in the gaps during a video conference.
But, as it turns out, lip-reading is a difficult task for both humans and computers.
That's because our mouths often make the same shapes for different words, according to Joon Son Chung, one of the researchers at Oxford.
""So, for example, pat, bat and mat are visually identical,"" Chung said.  
If you only see a mouth and don't hear a voice, it's very difficult to tell the different between ""bat"" and ""mat.""
That's the challenge of getting a computer to lip-read.
But the reason we're talking about this today is that there have been several recent improvements in this field.
And in some cases, computers can now lip-read better than humans.


The researchers created what they call . It's a new artificial intelligence software system.

Watch, Attend and Spell was created using an approach known as machine learning. The researchers created an algorithm — a neural network — that could learn over time.
They trained the algorithm by showing it thousands of hours of TV news footage from BBC.
The advantage of TV news is that it's relatively high-quality video and it includes lots of different faces and speaking styles.
Plus, the TV shows they used to train the algorithm were already captioned by professionals. So they could match the mouth movements to transcriptions of what had been said on-screen.

After the researchers trained their algorithm on these thousands of hours of TV, they put it to the test in the real world to see how it would perform on video without captions.
In other words, they wanted to see if their software could take what it had learned, and lip-read faces and mouths that it hadn't necessarily seen before.


It was surprisingly accurate.
It was able to get about 50 per cent of the words right.
Now, 50 per cent accuracy doesn't sound all that impressive until you compare it with human lip-reading experts. 
""We have given the same clips to the professional lip-readers and they seem to get less than one-quarter right,"" Chung said. 
So, the computer's performance is pretty impressive.


When I first heard about this research, my mind immediately turned to that scene in , where they reveal that the HAL 9000 computer can lip-read.
I thought about all the cameras in the world around us that are constantly capturing video, such as smartphone cameras or security cameras.
If it's possible to figure out what someone is saying using only an image of their mouth, the possibilities for surveillance and eavesdropping seem pretty creepy.
I asked Chung about this, and he told me that the system doesn't pose a serious privacy risk right now.
That's partly because most security cameras aren't high-quality enough to make this type of lip-reading work.
He also pointed out the software's 50 per cent accuracy rate.
""Yes, it's true, it can lip-read better than a human, but it still gets half the words wrong when used without the audio. So it's not really useful for privacy intrusive scenarios,"" Chung said. 
Even if you got a clear, high-resolution video feed of someone, you couldn't know for certain exactly what they were saying.

Like I said off the top, the researchers had accessibility in mind when designing this system. 
In particular, they thought about applications that could help people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.
This technology also has the potential to significantly improve general-purpose speech recognition as well.
I don't know about you, but I'm often frustrated when I use voice-based services like Siri, or Google Now or Alexa. Sometimes they work well for me, but other times, these voice assistants get things very wrong.

The researchers at Oxford believe that by combining voice recognition with lip-reading technology, that could dramatically improve the accuracy of these virtual assistants.
And there's another thing to consider: we tend to think of understanding speech as an auditory skill. But humans also pick up on visual cues to understand what's being said. 
In that way, when we combine speech recognition technology with lip-reading technology, we're building computer systems that mirror how humans perceive speech.
And if that can help Siri understand me a little better, that's a bonus.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/lip-reading-program-helps-accessibility-1.4034565?cmp=rss

Docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, is one of three omega-3 fatty acids thought to support growth of a baby's brain and tissues.

It is most commonly found in fish, but increasingly it's being marketed to pregnant women in the form of prenatal supplements. A search on Amazon.ca yields more than 40 results, many touting benefits for a baby's brain development.


""Use of these supplements has become common in developed countries, but the effects of DHA have been unclear,"" said the study's lead author, Jacqueline Gould, a child nutrition researcher with the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute.

To test the effect, her team gave one group of mothers 800 milligrams of DHA daily during the last half of pregnancy. The other group was given a placebo.

In the latest study, researchers followed up with more than 500 of those mothers' children at age seven and tested them for a variety of developmental outcomes, including IQ, language, academic abilities, and executive functions such as memory and problem solving.

They , besides slightly higher perceptual reasoning among those born to mothers who received DHA supplements. The results mirrored those found when the children were tested at age four.

""Our findings do not suggest that the DHA supplements caused benefit or harm for child development,"" Gould said.



""It's a good reminder to be wary of misinformation or all that marketing which goes into selling supplements that may not be necessary,"" said Jennifer House, a registered dietitian in Calgary.

Instead, House says it's always best to get omega-3 fatty acids like DHA from food such as salmon or trout, because they contain other nutrients including vitamin D, zinc, and iron.

Dietitians of Canada, as well as Health Canada, recommend that pregnant women eat 150 grams, or two servings the size of a deck of cards, of cooked fish each week.

For those who are concerned about mercury, Health Canada provides , like tuna, shark, and swordfish. But it says ""the benefits of eating fish are greater than not eating fish, when pregnant women choose the recommended types and amounts.""

House adds that a standard prenatal multivitamin, which includes folic acid and iron, should be enough for most women.



Ken Stark, an associate professor who studies omega-3 fatty acids at the University of Waterloo, says one of the challenges of this study is that it doesn't include information on the mothers' diets during pregnancy.

He points out that researchers tested the level of DHA in the blood of newborns' umbilical cords, and found that even the babies from mothers who didn't take supplements had relatively normal levels of DHA, suggesting the mothers were likely consuming enough of the fatty acid.

He also says animal studies have shown the brain is relatively good at retaining levels of DHA compared with other tissues, something he calls the ""brain effect.""

""It doesn't look like the control group in this original study were really that low in omega-3, and once you get that and the brain effect, if you're not really low [in DHA] then you're really not going to see much improvement with extra DHA,"" he says.
But he notes that DHA can have other benefits beyond brain development. He recently co-authored  that found fish oil supplements reduced a baby's risk of developing asthma.

Joneja says her husband dedicated his entire life to serving his community only to die of a heart attack before he could be treated, calling it, ""a very agonizing experience for both of us.""

Joneja who is a registered dietitian, says she brought her husband, Dr. Rajinder Joneja, to the hospital on March 12 and told medical staff he was suffering from acute chest pain.
She says her husband told a triage nurse about his medical history and chest pain symptoms and he was given two aspirin tablets without water and told to wait until he could be seen by a physician.
But after five minutes, Joneja says her husband went into cardiac arrest while she tried to flag a passing staff member.
She says help was too late in coming and he died in the hospital waiting room.

""I sat beside him, I held him, and I told him, 'I'm with you. I'm here.' He took his last breath in my arms.""
Joneja wrote Terry Lake, the Liberal MLA for Kamloops-North Thompson, and to medical staff at Royal Inland Hospital, urging them to take steps to ensure better medical treatment.
""No one, regardless of their position, should pass from this life in such traumatic, public and obviously avoidable circumstances.""

Heather Cook, executive director for acute services in Interior Health's West region, says health officials are reviewing Dr. Joneja's case and will be informing the family as the review is completed.

""Interior Health wishes to acknowledge the loss of a long-time member of the medical community. We know this is a difficult time for the family.""
Cook said in a statement that concerns over whether anything could have been done differently will be examined.
""As part of our review, we will be looking into whether protocols were followed. For example, in suspect cardiac cases, standard protocol is to provide a patient with aspirin, and for it to be chewed rather than swallowed to allow for quicker effect.""
Joneja believes medical staff should have transferred him immediately to a bed or trauma room. 
She pointed out the city is in dire need of a cardiology clinic similar to one in Kelowna, B.C.

The Mississauga girl had a 39 C fever and her symptoms seemed to be those of a common cold or influenza. But when Nupur couldn't stop shivering, her family took her to the emergency room at nearby Trillium Hospital.
That hospital visit became the first of two times her parents were told their daughter had influenza and could recover at home.
The third time Nupur's parents took her to the hospital, her heart stopped, and she had to be resuscitated.
Nupur has since had two limbs amputated — her left arm and right leg — and is surviving on dialysis at the Hospital for Sick Children, following a diagnosis of a serious bacterial infection caused by streptococcus A. Her family is now questioning why Trillium Hospital doctors didn't pick up on the severity of Nupur's symptoms sooner.
""One day, fever — OK. But three days, plus the pain … you don't just say 'oh, it's flu,'"" her mother Sunita told CBC Toronto.

Sunita said her daughter rarely gets sick. This time was different.
Initially, the family's doctor advised rest and Tylenol to keep Nupur's fever down. 
Then, when the family went to Trillium on Feb. 21, they waited four hours to see a doctor, Sunita said, adding that nurses were dismissing her concerns that her daughter had something worse than the flu. Frustrated, Sunita and Nupur went home to rest instead.
The next morning, Nupur woke up wincing with severe pain in her left arm and right leg, so they again rushed her to the emergency room.
This time, she had blood work and X-rays. They all came back clear.
""Everything points to influenza B,"" Sunita recalled the doctor saying, but that diagnosis didn't sit right with her.
""As far as I know, flu meant whole body pains, not in a particular part,"" she said.


It turned out a bacterial infection was attacking Nupur's body at a rapid pace. By Friday, her hands and feet felt cold to the touch.
""As a mom, I was doing all that I can. I put socks on her, I was rubbing her hands. After one hour, she said she doesn't have any feeling — she was completely numb,"" Sunita recalled.
Sunita called 911 that evening. 
Nupur's blood pressure was plummeting in the ambulance back to Trillium, her mom said. ""She was so pale. It was the first time I felt I was losing my daughter,"" Sunita said. 

Soon after arriving, Nupur's heart stopped. ""I heard a nurse say, 'She's dead,' then everyone, doctors and nurses, rushed over.""
Sunita says 10 to 15 doctors took turns performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on her daughter. 
Nupur stabilized and was taken to SickKids. Her body was pumped with antibiotics to stop the infection from attacking more of her insides, Sunita said.
While on life support for more than a week, and 17 days spent in the ICU at SickKids, blood culture tests finally revealed the real diagnosis: Nupur had a bacterial infection caused by streptococcus A.
The next revelation was that they had to amputate to stop it from spreading, and there was no saving the limbs Nupur had been complaining about: Physicians had to cut her left arm above the elbow and her right leg partially below the knee, her mom recalled.


Dr. Alison McGeer, infectious disease consultant at Mount Sinai hospital, says Nupur's bacterial infection is extremely rare — and that her case is an anomaly.
""Most often, streptococcus A will live in the nose and throat of people, and nothing will come of it,"" said McGeer, who is not involved in the family's health care.

She added it's a one-in-a-million instance for strep A to cause septic shock as it did in this case. There is also no vaccine to prevent a streptococcus A infection — and no way to tell who can fight the infection and who cannot.
""The tragedy is that for two or three days this condition just looks like a regular viral illness,"" McGeer said. ""And then all of the sudden, this very serious illness develops."" 

Sunita said when her daughter woke up to her missing arm and leg, she asked, ""How did this happen? I only had a cough."" 
While Nupur's family is questioning why the infection wasn't discovered sooner, McGeer said the doctors could not have predicted Mate's condition would advance the way it did. 
In a statement provided to CBC Toronto, Trillium Health Partners said they would not comment on the case due to patient confidentiality.
""When a patient presents at one of our emergency departments, they are assessed and triaged based on their current medical needs,"" the statement said.

After 17 days in the intensive care unit, Nupur is still at SickKids spending hours on dialysis as her kidneys heal. 
Sunita has quit her job to be by her daughter's side during her recovery. It isn't clear when she will be well enough to go home, and her family has launched a  to raise money to relieve some of the financial burden of Nupur's recovery. ​

Once her kidneys stabilize, her long journey in rehabilitation with prosthetics will begin. Nupur always loved swimming lessons and karate classes, her mom said, and Sunita said she's told her everything she wanted to do, she still can. 
""It attacked everything in her body but her spirit,"" she said.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/mississauga-girl-infection-1.4032910?cmp=rss

New research focusing on Toronto suggests that busy coffee shops and bank machines may be ideal locations for the life-saving devices.
When a cardiac arrest occurs, the survival rate decreases by 10 per cent for every minute that CPR and application of a defibrillator is delayed, emergency room doctors say. 


Until now, physicians, governments and community efforts have focused on placing automated external defibrillators or AEDs in shopping malls or office buildings so bystanders are able to access the devices to help when someone's heart  and stops beating.    
But previous Canadian research suggests about one in five cardiac arrests happened when a nearby defibrillator was in a location that was closed at the time, said Prof. Timothy Chan, director of the Centre for Healthcare Engineering at the University of Toronto.

Chan and his colleagues created two overlapping sets of Toronto maps to show where cardiac arrests occurred from 2007 through 2015 in relation to businesses with defibrillators, taking into account the business hours at each location. The researchers used information from paramedics, the Canadian Franchise Association, websites and in some cases personally visited locations to confirm the working hours.
The rankings were based on where cardiac arrests were the most frequent and where defibrillators were available when needed. 
Coffee shops (Tim Hortons, Starbucks and Second Cup) and automated bank machines of the five major Canadian banks topped the list of where defibrillators should be located, published in Monday's issue of the .
Tim Hortons was ranked first, with more than 300 shops in Toronto. The researchers estimated these locations alone would have provided AED coverage for more than 200 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests over an eight-year period.
What's more, the rankings were stable over time, Chan said.

The number of AEDs alone won't improve outcomes for patients, previous research suggests. Knowing where they are is key.
""Most people probably don't know where necessarily the closest AED is to them at any given point,"" Chan said in an interview. ""But you can probably have a rough idea where the closest Tim Horton's is, or where your ATM is because you might frequent that ATM a lot.""


Creating a mental link between AED and these places you're familiar with is ""so powerful in helping activate people to respond,"" he said.
The study's authors also found that ABMs, which are often standalone and outdoors and available 24/7, also ranked well. The ABMS also featured security cameras and protection from the elements and were broadly recognizable.
Green P public parking lots also made the list.

In total, there were 27,650 cardiac arrests in the city over the study period, of which 2,654 occurred in public.
Cardiac arrests are a life and death situation, said study co-author Dr. Steven Brooks, an emergency physician in Kingston, Ont. Even if AEDs are well placed, it doesn't mean they'll be used in an emergency.
""We have to start thinking beyond the traditional approach of simply placing them, hanging a sign and then crossing our fingers, hoping that they will be used when the time comes,"" Brooks said.
There are opportunities to use innovative strategies, such as drone-delivered AEDs and crowdsourced apps to bring members of the public, AED locations and their delivery together with 911 dispatch services. The goal is to get CPR and AED to every victim of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest within two minutes of their collapse, Brooks said.

Brooks, who also works on drone delivery of AEDs in residential and rural areas, envisions these approaches coming together, perhaps alongside miniaturization of AED technology so that mobile devices could be used to defibrillate.
""Once all of these pieces of the puzzle come together, I predict that we will see a drastic increase in the number of people surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,"" Brooks said.
A journal editorial accompanying the study praised how the research marries expertise in emergency medicine, mechanical and industrial engineering to inform public policy with a method that could be applied to other cities.
But whether systemically deploying AEDs at high-ranking businesses in fact increases rates of bystander AED and survival still needs to be tested.
Ideally, companies would partner with local paramedics and advocacy groups to place an AED at each business site and even market that the device is available, said editorial author Dr. Richard Page, chair of the department of medicine at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. 
""That would go a long way toward broad distribution of AEDs and public awareness of where an AED might be obtained for immediate use,"" Page said in an email. ""This could translate to lives saved.""
Chan expects coffee chains and banks will be open to participating for charity and to promote good will while enhancing their brand. ",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/defibrillators-coffee-shops-abms-1.4033142?cmp=rss
d3405a9f647f7ba1e060b2ff197ba1634639fede,Reuters,2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,"Care guidelines for cancer survivors often unclear, review finds","Treatment guidelines on care for survivors of the most common cancers often lack specifics or offer conflicting advice about when or how often to do certain tests, a review of recent recommendations finds.
Researchers examined cancer guidelines from North America and Europe that have been published since 2010 to advise doctors on the best ways to care for survivors of nine malignancies: breast, colorectal, lung, prostate, melanoma, uterine, bladder, thyroid and testicle.
They found ambiguous recommendations in 83 per cent of the guidelines. In particular, different guidelines for the same type of cancer often didn't address all the same surveillance tests, and few tests were universally recommended, noted lead study author Dr. Ryan Merkow of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
When guidelines did endorse tests, they rarely specified how long patients should continue to get tested.
""Often our instincts as providers are to order more tests — it makes us feel like we are caring for the patient, and it makes the patient feel like they are being cared for,"" Merkow said by email.
In certain instances this is absolutely the correct approach, in others, it may lead to additional and unnecessary procedures and patient anxiety, Merkow added. ""We have to approach surveillance in a deliberate and thoughtful manner as the risk of over and under-treatment is real.""

Worldwide, an estimated 33 million people are cancer survivors, and their ranks are expected to grow due to rising cancer rates in an aging population as well as improved survival odds with advances in diagnosis and treatment, researchers note in .
For the current study, Merkow's team focused on what's known as surveillance, or efforts to detect the return of cancer or the development of tumours in other parts of the body. This can include invasive tests like biopsies that come with their own risks and side-effects as well as expensive imaging like positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning.
They reviewed 41 guidelines addressing post-treatment surveillance, with three to six recommendations focused on each of the nine cancer types examined. Overall, 37 of these guidelines, or 90 per cent, recommended physical exams and medical history. Most addressed some form of imaging (83 per cent), while 63 per cent covered what's known as endoscopic procedures that involve doctors using a flexible tube with a camera to examine the inside of the digestive tract.
In 23 of the guidelines, or 56 per cent, recommendations touched on lab tests to look for biomarkers of certain types of tumours, which are typically found in blood, urine or body tissue.
Guidelines for using PET scans offer a snapshot of the mixed messages in surveillance recommendations. Only one of the guidelines in the study recommended patients get this scan, and it was for bladder cancer.
Other guidelines either didn't address PET scans or advised against them, which was the case for 67 per cent of uterine cancer recommendations and 60 per cent of lung cancer recommendations.
The most ambiguous recommendations for PET scan use were for tumours of the bladder, prostate and breast.
European guidelines were more likely than North American guidelines to contain ambiguous recommendations, the study also found.
Limitations of the study include its focus on national recommendations, which excluded widely followed provincial practice guidelines in Canada, the authors note. The study also didn't include recommendations published after February 2016.
Even so, the results highlight the work that still needs to be done to better standardize care for patients who have undergone cancer treatment, said Dr. Alexander Kutikov, a researcher at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia who wasn't involved in the study.
""Clinical utility versus patient expectations versus costs must be thoughtfully balanced,"" Kutikov said by email.

Dr. Harry Henteleff says Horizon Health Network officials contacted him a few weeks ago to ask if his team could help, since the Saint John region's only thoracic surgeon is on indefinite medical leave and the Moncton region's only thoracic surgeon is also ""on leave.""
""We reviewed it with our local group and the conclusion was that without extra resources to handle the extra workload, we couldn't take them,"" said Henteleff.
""The reason was that our patients are waiting about two to three times the national standards for wait times for cancer surgery, so if you added a whole bunch of extra patients in, then that would just make our excessive wait list become even longer.""
A thoracic surgeon in Quebec has, however, agreed to take New Brunswick referrals.




Thoracic surgeons are specialists who deal with structures of the chest, such as the esophagus, lungs, and diaphragm muscle, but not the heart.
They treat diseases ranging from cancer to gastroesophageal reflux, remove benign tumours, perform chest reconstruction after major traumas and handle lung transplants.

Internal Horizon emails obtained by CBC News have described the lack of thoracic surgery coverage in Saint John and Moncton regions as a ""crisis.""
But during a news conference last Friday, Dr. Edouard Hendriks, vice-president of medical, academic and research affairs, downplayed the seriousness of the situation, calling it ""difficult,"" but not a ""crisis.""
Hendriks said all patients in the region who need thoracic surgery have been successfully referred to other surgeons and none have faced ""undue delays.""
""We also, of course, got in touch with our colleagues in Halifax and even in the province of Quebec to ensure that if at some point … New Brunswick is not able to meet all the demand that we have quickly and easily, ways to refer these patients elsewhere,"" Hendriks had said.




Similarly, an internal Horizon email from the chief of surgery Dr. David Tees to physicians dated March 14 states: ""Please find enclosed a list of surgeons that may be called upon to see a patient in consultation.""
It lists nine surgeons, including Henteleff and his three thoracic surgeon colleagues in Halifax, who together serve all of Nova Scotia.
Henteleff contends the email is incorrect and the Halifax surgeons will not be seeing New Brunswick patients.
""I can tell you what my conversation was with Dr. Tees, I said, 'I regret to say that we can't take the patients,'"" said Henteleff.
Cancer patients in Nova Scotia are already waiting an estimated eight to 12 weeks for thoracic surgery instead of the recommended four, he said.




The Halifax surgeons did offer to take turns flying to Saint John and Moncton to perform surgeries, but have not yet received a response from Horizon, said Henteleff.
The proposal was for two surgeons to make multiple trips, performing as many operations as possible during each visit, roughly three in 12 hours, with local physicians handling the patient follow-ups, he said.

Dr. Rosaire Vaillancourt, of the Quebec Heart and Lung Institute in Montreal, said he is ""quite happy to help"" with New Brunswick's ""unfortunate"" and unusual situation.
""It's real bad luck that your two main thoracic surgeons in the province are sick at the same time,"" said Vaillancourt, who used to work in New Brunswick at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton from 1992 until 2000, practising cardiovascular and thoracic surgery before specializing further.
He considers it his ""duty"" to assist his New Brunswick colleagues and the patients, who require the ""specialized care.""
He's only had one referral so far, and he expects to see her ""soon,"" he said.
""I'm basically just waiting that she has her PET scan in Saint John and then I will see the patient.""
The other four physicians listed in the Horizon email as possible consults include general surgeons in Fredericton, Moncton and Edmundston, and an internal and respiratory medicine specialist in Moncton, according to the provincial College of Physicians and Surgeons registry.
The general surgeon in Fredericton, however, has an asterisk beside his name in the memo, indicating ""presently full and would prefer no more for now.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/thoracic-surgery-saint-john-horizon-halifax-1.4027503?cmp=rss

The 21-year-old drug user broke down as she spoke to the Toronto health board Monday about the death of her former roommate and friend, Brooklyn McNeil, who died last summer just weeks after advocating for supervised injection sites in this city.

McNeil died alone after overdosing near a dumpster, Trypis said through tears.

""There's nothing OK about what happened to her.""

The city's seen a 73 per cent increase in overdose deaths between 2004 and 2015, with many of those being linked to powerful opioids like fentanyl. In 2015, 135 opioid users died after overdosing, a figure Dr. Barbara Yaffe, the acting medical officer of health, said was ""far too many.""


Yaffe warned that if the city doesn't act quickly it could wind up dealing with a surge of deaths, similar to what has happened in Vancouver.
The new report contains more than 25 recommendations the city will be trying to swiftly implement, including:



Coun. Joe Cressy said sharing details about the overdose crisis will allow the public to better understand the issue.

""They're dying in the shadows,"" he said, following the meeting.

""When we take drug use out of the shadows and into the public light we treat it like any other health issue.""


Trypis and several other outreach workers welcomed the city's approach, which has sought the opinion of drug users.

Still, Trypis said she wants to see a timeline as to when the supervised injection sites will open, and called on the city to work quickly to develop the capability to test if drugs are tainted.

""It needs to happen right now,"" she said, adding she's scared every time she's using that someone has laced the drugs with something else.

Karen Shaw from the Parkdale Community Health Centre said the city's plan will make a big difference on the street.

""It helps addicts out there to know that their lives are valuable to other people, too,"" she said.

Shaw said she hopes the city finds a way to have police no longer respond to overdose calls, because the threat of being arrested scares many drug users.


The city will also be working with the Indigenous community to try to find specific responses for that community.

Shortly before the vote, Coun. Christin Carmichael Greb resigned from the health board, threatening its ability to vote on the motion. The board did manage to maintain quorum and voted unanimously in favour of the report.
Carmichael Greb's office issued a statement Tuesday saying she resigned from the health board because of her commitments on several other city boards, not because she opposed the action plan. A spokesperson from her office said she planned to attend the entire meeting, but had to leave for a prior commitment when the debate went longer than expected.
""My motive was to spend the time needed to support the residents of my ward,"" Carmichael Greb said in a statement.
The health board's decision doesn't need the approval of the full city council.
The board also passed a motion from Coun. Joe Mihevc to ask the provincial health ministry for about $375,000 to hire three people to help with implementing the plan.



Before the vote, Matt Johnson, a harm reduction outreach worker with the Queen West Central Toronto Community Health Centre, praised the city's actions and pleaded with them to approve the plan.

""There is no evidence that chiropractic is effective in treating cancer and autism and any of those things that they are apparently claiming that they can treat,"" said Dr. Alan Katz, director of the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy.
A CBC News analysis of company websites and Facebook pages of every registered chiropractor in Manitoba found several dozen examples of statements, claims and social media content at odds with many public health policies or medical research.
Examples include:


Based on the Manitoba Chiropractors Association membership listing, there are approximately 275 licensed practitioners working out of 215 offices. CBC News found questionable online content linked to more than 30 chiropractic offices.
Dr. Katz reviewed the examples gathered by the CBC I-Team and labelled most of them ""misinformation.""
""It misleads the public in two areas. Firstly, those who choose to go for chiropractic care, particularly for things like infection and autism and things that we know they're not going to be beneficial for, it misleads those individuals and gives them false hope for treatment that will not be effective,"" he said.
""Putting these things up on their website also puts the doubt in the minds of others about what we do know works, and as a result those people may not seek the right type of care for conditions that could deteriorate if they don't seek that care.""

The Manitoba Chiropractors Association declined an interview request but did say it would review the content.

""As the regulatory body that oversees the practice of chiropractic in Manitoba, we will review the material you have shared with us in a thorough manner as provided for by our internal processes,"" said Ernie Miron, a chiropractic doctor and the association registrar.
The Manitoba Chiropractors Association has previously addressed certain issues with its membership through an internal communication.
""In Manitoba, the administration of 'vaccination and immunization' currently falls outside the scope of chiropractic practice,"" the communication said. It also cautioned members that:

The association also said, ""The degree to which a chiropractor can or cannot discuss 'vaccination and immunization' or other health-care procedures that are outside the scope of practice with a patient is currently being reviewed by the board of directors.""
CBC News reached out to several chiropractors for comment about their online content. Calls and emails were either not returned, or interview requests were declined.

Manitoba is the only province in the country that universally covers a portion of chiropractic treatments for all residents, to a limit of 12 visits per year.
In 2016, the province paid out $11.9 million for a total of 984,432 claims from 166,897 unique patients.

The fact that members of a regulated health profession are actively disseminating questionable medical information while benefiting from public funds is cause for concern, Katz said.
""Should we as a society be paying for the services of professionals, and I use that word loosely, that are advocating care that is contrary to the official public policy?""
Manitoba's health minister didn't comment on the issue, but Manitoba Health provided a statement after it was given examples of the information.
""We offer a publicly funded vaccine program that follows national guidelines on immunization and we encourage Manitobans to get vaccinated. But vaccination is always a matter of informed consent between a practitioner and a patient, based on an informed evaluation of the benefits and risks. If any practitioner provides advice that is contrary to our position, we do not agree with it.""


A letter by Winnipeg chiropractor Henri Marcoux was published last February in Manitoba's francophone weekly newspaper , in response to an article in which a regional health authority expert was interviewed about influenza immunizations.

Marcoux wrote that he does not recommend flu vaccines, calling them ""toxic."" He further stated that the flu virus actually ""purifies our systems"" and said that he believes flu vaccines are ""driven by a vast operation orchestrated by pharmaceutical companies.""
People should instead focus on general wellness — which includes chiropractic treatment — to stave off the flu, he wrote.

Now-retired chiropractor and long-time anti-vaccination advocate Gérald Bohémier wrote a later letter in support of Marcoux that also appeared in .

Letters then poured in from members of the community, including a resident and two physicians who took exception to these statements.
Marcoux told the CBC's French service, Radio-Canada, that he does not believe his views are at odds with public health.
He stands by his letter, he said, adding if society as a whole took health and wellness more seriously — rather than trying to treat symptoms — the need for vaccines would dissipate or never would have existed in the first place.

""Addressing the issue of harassment in public places and the victim blaming-and-shaming that occurs throughout the reporting and judicial system will be key to prevent violence and to ensure that survivors do not suffer further at the hands of the police, the RCMP and the judiciary,"" Conservative MP and committee chair Marilyn Gladu told a news conference Monday.
The committee, which heard from 99 witnesses over the last year on what the federal government can do to reduce violence against young women and girls, focused its 45 recommendations on campus sexual assault, harassment in public, cyberviolence and better treatment by the justice system of those reporting gender-based violence and sexual assault.
The recommendation on the judiciary is similar to a private member's bill tabled by interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose that would require mandatory training for would-be judges on issues surrounding sexual assault.

The report also discusses ""rape culture,"" and how behaviour that some might not consider overly serious — sexual jokes or the objectification of women in the media, for instance — can create the conditions for sexualized violence.
""Witnesses told the committee about a pervasive climate of rape culture in Canada that normalizes, excuses and tolerates violence against young women and girls in public spaces, across universities and college campuses, and online,"" said Liberal MP and committee vice-chair Pam Damoff.
In response to a question about Sen. Don Meredith, who is under pressure to quit following a damning report from the ethics officer into his sexual relationship with a teenager, Gladu said it reveals just how pervasive the problem can be.
""I think it says that this behaviour is common, it's across all classes, it's happening everywhere in our country and we need to take steps to eliminate it.""

Status of Women Minister Maryam Monsef is expected to unveil a federal gender-based violence strategy in the coming weeks, which she has said will look at ways to prevent violence and support its survivors, but also how to improve the criminal justice system.
MPs on the committee said they hope the report will help Monsef, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to implement the strategy, including by working with provinces and territories to tackle issues outside federal jurisdiction.
Monsef said she would respond soon.
""The ongoing work of the (committee) plays an integral part of our government's commitment to gender equality, to empowering women and girls, and to ensuring that women and girls can live free from violence,"" she said in a statement.

Other recommendations include working with the provinces and territories to figure out how to require all colleges and universities to set up sexual assault centres and exploring whether the Criminal Code needs to explicitly include cyberviolence and online harassment, so long as it would not violate charter-protected freedom of speech.
Liberal MP Sean Fraser, one of two male MPs on the committee, said men and boys have a role to play.
""Ending violence against women is not simply a women's issue — it's a people's issue,"" he said.
Conservative MP Rachael Harder said her party's supplementary report called for a better examination of the negative effects of violent pornography, as well as longer — and better enforced — sentences for perpetrators of sexual assault.
The NDP called for a national action plan on gender-based violence involving the provinces and territories to better ensure access to services — and their funding — is comparable across the country.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/gender-based-violence-women-girls-report-1.4033024?cmp=rss

The Canadian actor was standing alongside the film's creative team onstage after their film was announced as winner of best picture when ""people start to have this panicked reaction in the crowd and guys were coming on with headsets and I felt like someone had been hurt,"" he said, describing the moment as ""surreal."" 
""I thought there was some kind of medical situation, and I had this worst-case scenario playing out in my head ... and then I just heard won and I was so relieved that I started laughing,"" he said.

The budget promised an extra $1.8 billion for culture and recreation over the next decade, starting next year. More than $1.3 billion will go to the provinces and territories via bilateral agreements but the budget didn't say how they can spend it, or how much would be allocated to arts and culture facilities in particular.
Pierre-Olivier Herbert of Canadian Heritage told CBC News the money could be used to fund cultural spaces like community recreation centres and history complexes.
There was a focus on Indigenous languages and cultures, with the government promising $89.9 million over the next three years for improving the existing Aboriginal Languages Initiative, digitizing language and cultural materials and creating archive and educational tools based on oral history.

The budget also earmarked $300 million over the next 10 years to go to Canada Cultural Spaces Fund, which deals with arts and culture infrastructure, like building, renovating and equipping museums and music halls. It's something the Canadian Arts Coalition had been asking for more of.
""We are very pleased to see the investment in infrastructure,"" said Kate Cornell, the coalition's spokesperson. The fund was also given $168.2 million over two years in last year's budget.
Cornell didn't expect a great deal for the industry in this year's budget because of the big boost given to the country's largest cultural institutions last year — in 2016,  to the CBC, Canada Council, the National Film Board and national museums, among other institutions.

Cornell said she was a bit surprised there was no mention of the Showcasing Canada program in this year's budget, which helps Canadian artists promote themselves abroad. It was promised two years of funding in the 2016 budget, so she said she is not ""extremely worried"" about its future and will press the government to continue it.
There was also no mention of the , something that ticked off CARFAC, the national association of visual artists.
The association has been gunning to get the ARR added to the Canadian Copyright Act since 2011 — it would ensure artists are compensated when their work is re-sold at a higher price than what it was originally purchased for.

""Artists have been waiting a long time for Canada to legislate the ARR, and this was a huge missed opportunity to provide support for artists,"" CARFAC national president Susan Tooke said in a statement.
And while the budget promised to modernize the Broadcast Act and Telecommunications Act to bring it into a digital age, there weren't any details about what this would look like or mean for media or content creators.

On earth.
The raising of the Klingon Empire flag in northern Ontario this week doesn't mean the battle-hungry alien race of warriors, made popular in the television franchise, has conquered the region.
The demonstration, and the proclamation from the mayor that March 23 is Klingon Empire Day in Timmins, is to celebrate 50 years of Klingons on-screen.
The  episode  was first broadcast on March 23, 1967, featuring Canadian actor John Colicos portraying Commander Kor.


This week's events were organized by a fan group in Timmins called Crimson Dawn.
The group is also a chapter of an international fan organization called the Klingon Assault Group.
There are many reasons to honour the alien race, said Crimson Dawn group member Karen Hutchinson, also known by her Klingon title of ""Lieutenant TlharnoQ.""
""Klingons are very honest people, very passionate people. They are very straight-to-the-point and are very concerned with honour as a society,"" Hutchinson said.
Hutchinson said she watched her first episode of when she was three years old.
""Like many young people, I thought the bad guys were cool,"" she said. ""In the original series, Klingons were the bad guys.""

But this revival is a little different from the rest. Unlike the aforementioned programs, Power Rangers never actually stopped running.

While the new movie, directed by Dean Israelite, lifts its characters from the original series, Saban Entertainment has been making season after season of brightly coloured superhero adventures with a new cast of rangers (and a new line of toys) every year.


Sure, it hasn't recaptured the heights of its popularity when it launched as  in 1993, when its mix of campy high school antics and monster fighting took North America by storm.

Power Rangers action figures were that year's Cabbage Patch Kids dolls and the mainstream press whipped up panic over reports that kids were karate-kicking each other in schoolyards. A live appearance by the actors in Los Angeles' Universal Studios in 1994 caused massive freeway gridlock.
But as a sign of its lingering popularity and the sheer volume of material available, livestreaming site Twitch is currently airing a marathon of every  episode ever produced — 23 seasons and 831 episodes running consecutively over the course of 17 days.
That's a whole lot of martial arts, spandex suits and giant robot-versus-monster fights.


""There's just a never-ending wealth of stuff to talk about with Power Rangers,"" says Diana McCallum, writer and co-host of the  podcast.

""It's got a near-unlimited resource of things to discuss. It's more like a comic book franchise than a TV show, in that way.""



The film's setup is the same as the show that started it all. Five high schoolers of varying degrees of delinquency are chosen to become a group of super-powered heroes tasked with saving the world.

The colour-coded squad fight off the evil witch Rita Repulsa and her legion of golem-like monsters with a mixture of martial arts and robot dinosaurs called Zords.

Elizabeth Banks provides a sleek new take on the cackling villainess and Bryan Cranston plays Zordon, a former Red Ranger and mentor to the new team. Meanwhile, Bill Hader provides CG-fuelled comic relief as the assistant robot Alpha-5. (This isn't Cranston's first Power Rangers role — he voiced a few monsters-of-the-day in the original TV program.)

McCallum attributes the show's longevity to its simple focus and positive messages.


""There are no heavy moral conundrums; the team doesn't ever fight amongst themselves,"" she says. ""It's such a clear-cut good-versus-evil fight, that it's really easy to watch.""

And its diverse leading cast was a godsend for a nerdy girl in the '90s.

""Power Rangers has girls in every single episode, and they're part of the team,"" she says. ""It was really important, because I was a nerd, and all of my friends were guys, and they made me be April O'Neil if we were playing Ninja Turtles. And I was like, 'Ugh, I don't get to do any martial arts.' But when they played Power Rangers, I got to be a Power Ranger.""

Israelite's film builds on the diversity trend. Billy the blue ranger, played by RJ Cyler, is on the autism spectrum. And one scene suggests that Trini the yellow ranger, played by singer and social media star Becky G, is struggling with her sexual orientation.




While the film attempts a new interpretation of the franchise, fans have been delving deeper into its roots.

Like G-Force and Robotech before it, Power Rangers was originally adapted from a Japanese source — the superhero show Super Sentai.

Saban Entertainment hired American actors to play the part of the heroes' civilians and paired it with fight scenes and other footage from the most recent Super Sentai season to cut costs.

Super Sentai has an even longer history than Power Rangers, dating all the way back to 1975. Every year, Toei Entertainment introduces a new Sentai team. With few exceptions, they're used as the foundation of a new season of  the following year.

Awareness of Power Rangers' Japanese origins has risen over the years, as fans began translating and sharing unreleased seasons of Super Sentai and comparing the differences between it and the western versions.

In 2015, Shout Factory secured the North American rights to release a DVD of , the season that the original  drew from.


""It was always a little iffy as to whether Super Sentai would ever hit North America, because you suddenly have the potential for brand confusion with Power Rangers,"" said Brian Ward, Shout Factory's senior director of video production and digital media.

The DVD sold so well, they've since released three more seasons, with more on the way.



The big challenge for the Power Rangers movie — and the franchise as a whole — will be balancing how it caters to the continuing influx of younger viewers and adults who grew up with Power Rangers.

""There will always be a tightrope between hardcore fans who have been there since the beginning — and can sometimes seem like gatekeepers to the property — and being accessible to new fans,"" says Ward.

""But I think if any franchise can do it, Power Rangers can do it. They literally reinvent themselves every year. And they have always been able to welcome new audiences with every new season.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/power-rangers-movie-nostalgia-1.4033536?cmp=rss

The Alberta capital is still a city in training when it comes to film infrastructure, he said.

""There just isn't the gear, the camera, the lighting, the grip, camera cars, process trailers, none of that stuff exists here,"" Maxxis told CBC's morning current affairs show, Edmonton AM. ""So it has to be brought in and it's expensive to travel all that gear here.""

The director of  has come up with an impressive cast — actors Hopper Penn, Rosanna Arquette, Michael Madsen and singer Elle King are making the trip — but Maxxis said he is also having to bring in experienced film crews.


""If there's another shoot going on, lots of shoots in Calgary or something, there's just not many people available so you have to bring lots of people in, which also costs money.""

Maxxis' $3 million film will be shot exclusively in the Edmonton area over the next five weeks. He's already done scenes at West Edmonton Mall and restaurants in the Strathcona neighbourhood.

Coincidentally, $3 million is the same amount the provincial government cut from the Alberta Media Fund in its budget last week.

The film industry will get $34 million this year instead of $37 million, a decision Michael Jorgensen, chair of the Alberta Media Production Industries Association, believes is a step backwards. 

""The incentives are just not here in Alberta to bring in the kind of production that it does in provinces like British Columbia and Ontario,"" Jorgensen said.

The provincial government should take a cue from B.C. where the film industry has generated 17,000 jobs and $2.2 billion compared to 2,000 jobs and $252 million in Alberta, he said.

""In a time when Alberta is looking to diversify the economy and create some significant economic impact, there's a real missed opportunity I think here.""


Maxxis agreed tax credits are vital for film companies looking to branch out to new locations.

""If it wasn't for that, this film wouldn't be shooting here,"" he said. ""Especially a place with no infrastructure for film.""

Maxxis has directed movie videos and commercials over the past 12 years and lived in Toronto, Los Angeles and New Orleans before moving back to Edmonton a few years ago. 


The upside of shooting in Edmonton, he said, is the people who've come into the film community.

""Everyone you work with that's from here … is so friendly and easy going and just human,"" he said. ""And not jaded by the film industry at all, they haven't been exploited by it.""
He also said it has been easy to get permission to shoot in various locations around the city and to find street cast.

""I had a lot of time to really study the locations and pick places that visually complement the story and the drama,"" he said.

The spreading boycott confronts Google with a challenge that threatens to cost it hundreds of millions of dollars.

YouTube's popularity stems from its massive and eclectic library of video, spanning everything from polished TV clips to raw diatribes posted by people bashing homosexuals.
But that diverse selection periodically allows ads to appear next to videos that marketers find distasteful, despite Google's efforts to prevent it from happening.
Google depends largely on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute.

Earlier this week, Google vowed to step up its efforts to block ads on ""hateful, offensive and derogatory"" videos.
""We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us,"" Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, wrote in a Tuesday blog post.
As part of Google's solution to the problem, Schindler promised to hire ""significant numbers"" of employees to review YouTube videos and flag them as inappropriate for ads. He also predicted YouTube would be able to address advertisers' concerns through Google's recent advancements in artificial intelligence — technology parlance for computers that learn to think like humans.
But that promise so far hasn't appeased AT&amp;T, Verizon Communications and an expanding global list of advertisers that includes Volkswagen, Audi, HSBC Holdings, the Royal Bank of Scotland and L'Oreal.
""We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,"" AT&amp;T said in a statement. ""Until Google can ensure this won't happen again, we are removing our ads from Google's non-search platforms.""

By extending its ban to everything beyond Google's search results, AT&amp;T is also effectively pulling its ads from more than two million other websites that depend on Google to deliver ads to their pages.
In its statement, Verizon said it decided to pull ads from YouTube to protect its website while it investigates the ""weak links"" among its digital advertising partners.
Both AT&amp;T and Verizon may have an ulterior motive to make YouTube look like an untrustworthy spot for marketers because both companies are trying to sell more digital ads in their own networks.
YouTube has become one of the fastest growing parts of Google's ad system, which generated $79 billion US in revenue last year. Google doesn't disclose how much of that came from YouTube ads, but the research firm eMarketer estimated that the video site accounted for $5.6 billion of that amount. EMarketer projected YouTube's advertising will rise 26 per cent this year to $7 billion, but that prediction came before marketers began to suspend their spending.
The YouTube boycott began late last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in videos delving into contentious themes.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/google-youtube-videos-ads-1.4037468?cmp=rss

Sure, many have written off the game shows as mindless and low-brow. But the trio of game shows put out by Chuck Barris, , have had a lasting legacy.
Robert Thompson, a pop culture and television professor at Syracuse University, said Barris's ""fingerprints"" are all over more current shows like   and the franchise.
""He had come up with that idea way earlier and it took a while for the rest of these other people to realize what he had.""

The show launched in 1965 to great success. It wasn't the first game to try and get people together without them seeing each other (the U.S. version of started in 1949) but Thompson said Barris brought the concept into the ""hip new era of the 1960s.""
He says  ""took one of those ideas that had been floating around since the 1940s, established it in a big hit show and that virus then spread all over the place.""


 
Thompson thinks the show was Barris's ""most enduring legacy.""
A fair point considering similar shows that sprung up abroad, including Britain's and Australia's .

Soon after, in 1966, Barris launched a show pitting married couples against each other with pretty funny results. It's where host Bob Eubanks coined the phrase ""making whoopie,"" a slang term for having sex which 


 
John Brunton of Insight Productions, a producer who helmed reality shows like and  said proved that Barris had a knack for mining people for entertainment.
""I think that it was tapping into the comedy of couples,"" he said.
""He turned the cameras back on real people.""

Barris took a turn with this 1976 daytime game show, which saw him hosting bizarre amateur performers who were trying to avoid the gong of the celebrity judges. The show specialized in bad acts.
In this format, Brunton said Barris was one of the original people to create ""really compelling television and comedy out of bad talent.""


 
It's become a staple of reality television today — from the nightmare performances that get the X on the franchise to the terrible singers who show up in the early audition stage of the  series.
""He changed the definition of comedy in a way, and it wasn't written comedy,"" Brunton said. ""It was found comedy."" 

Barris would go on to produce and oversee other shows, including flops like  and . But he had already cemented his influence.
""I think Chuck Barris was way ahead of his time. He was making these dating shows long before everybody else figured out what a great genre this could be,"" Thompson, the university professor said.
""If we want to realize what a brilliant artist Chuck Barris was, we have to totally rethink the criteria we use in evaluating what exactly is art.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/chuck-barris-legacy-1.4036333?cmp=rss

Now art enthusiasts and history buffs can follow along in real time, thanks to an Ottawa man who has recreated Thomson's final months on Twitter.
Tim Bouma runs the account  and the blog . He first began documenting Thomson's final spring in Algonquin Park in 2011, and he's revamped the account this year for the 100th anniversary of the artist's death.
""The story of [Thomson's] last spring is such a great story,"" Bouma told host Hallie Cotnam on CBC's . ""There's lots of work out there, but nothing has been brought together from Tom Thomson's point of view.""





Bouma grew up in the same village as Thomson near Owen Sound, Ont. As a lifelong fan, he was inspired to create the Twitter account by another that posts historical moments from the Second World War in real time.
The tweets are automated, based on a schedule Bouma created when he first undertook the project. 

""I knew that he had painted about 60 to 62 sketches that spring, one a day,"" he said. ""So I found about 45 of them, through references and that, then I looked at them and tried to figure out exactly what point in time he would have painted them. And then from that I generated a series of tweets.""
Bouma tweaks the content from year to year. He has special plans this year to commemorate Thomson's mysterious death on July 8, 1917, including a camping trip in the park and a fireside reading.
""My hope is that we'll be canoeing ... recreating the sequence of events exactly as they played out 100 years ago in a canoe,"" he said.

Thanks to his research and his popular blog and Twitter account, Bouma has emerged as an expert on Thomson's work. A dealer from Spokane, Wash., reached out to him recently to confirm that a sketch he had picked up in Italy was in fact created by the artist.

""I saw it, and I just fell out of my chair. I looked at it and said, this is a Thomson, absolutely. I was so familiar with the environment he was painting in, I was familiar with his style, and this was a sketch that appeared,"" he said.
The dealer let him have the sketch, which Bouma estimates could be worth about $1.2 million. 
As his Twitter account begins to generate steam once again as it follow's Thomson's last spring in Algonquin Park, the excitement is building for Bouma.
""I feel like the man behind the curtain. I feel like I've really plugged into a really neat cultural vein. It's amazing. I get about 60,000 views a day, I get a couple hundred interactions a day, and it's all people that just love Tom Thomson. They love camping. They love Algonquin Park.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/tom-thomson-last-spring-1.4037451?cmp=rss
160b72082feaadf718211d7ce7ab18b650408f7f,Sandy Cohen,2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,"Missed, not missing: Richard Simmons' withdrawal sparks fascination ","Officially, Richard Simmons is not missing.
His publicist, manager, brother and two officers from the Los Angeles Police Department have all said the 68-year-old fitness guru is at his Hollywood Hills mansion and doing fine. Simmons said the same himself when he , explaining he was safe and well and that ""it's time right now for Richard Simmons to take care of Richard Simmons.""
But he has been missing from the spotlight for three years — and that was enough for Dan Taberski, a former producer of , to create the  podcast. Taberski has spent six episodes investigating his subject's whereabouts, making it the most popular podcast in the country and inspiring a national obsession with Simmons' well-being. The final episode was released this week.
So how can a public figure step away from the spotlight in this plugged-in, celebrity-obsessed culture, where everyone has a camera in his pocket and a potential podcast in the making? And what are the ethical implications of publicly searching for someone who says he or she needs some private time?

Billed as an act of love by Taberski,  has been ""harmful,"" said Michael Catalano, Simmons' manager and friend for 30 years. It resurrected old rumours — that Simmons is changing his gender or being held hostage by his housekeeper — and heaped unwanted attention on his respite.
""He didn't need this intrusion to validate his contribution to people,"" Catalano said in an interview Tuesday.
""He knows the reception [the podcast] is having. He knows how people are responding to it. But it's also hurtful. It's humiliating, you know? It's damaging. It just is ...

""Anywhere he goes now there's going to be — more than there was before — pointing and speculation. Has he transitioned into a woman? Is that him behind that beard? I don't envy that. I don't envy that for someone, who at this time, has chosen to retreat. He has the right! I just don't think because you are on the public stage for 40 years that you have to continue to remain there until your last breath.""

Simmons did not participate in the podcast and hasn't given any interviews since speaking to   and  in March 2016. Once ubiquitous on talk shows, celebrity-home tours and at his own Beverly Hills workout studio, he hasn't been seen publicly since February 2014. He also stopped corresponding with former students and friends.
Taberski, who declined to be interviewed for this story, considered himself one of those friends. After getting to know the fitness guru by taking classes at the now-shuttered Slimmons, Taberski pitched him on making a documentary about his life. Simmons considered it but ultimately passed, Catalano said.
About six months later, Catalano learned that Taberski was contacting some of Simmons' friends and requesting interviews for a podcast.

 clearly reflects Taberski's admiration for his subject's business acumen and personal generosity. Simmons may have inspired millions with his  exercise videos, but he also personally called dozens of overweight and isolated people each day to encourage them toward better health and self-esteem. Taberski features several of them on the podcast, along with many of the regular students at Slimmons, all of whom considered Simmons a personal friend.

Simmons' warm persona and previous accessibility, combined with the expected omnipresence of today's celebrities and an ever-growing array of broadcast outlets, has made his voluntary withdrawal from public life seem like an intractable Hollywood mystery.
""People don't understand, or it is certainly anomalous, that someone would actually not want to be famous or seek anonymity after having great fame,"" said JD Heyman, deputy editor of People magazine, which is featuring Simmons on this week's cover.
""That's an old Hollywood story. That's as old as Greta Garbo.""

But where Garbo consistently eschewed fame's trappings before retiring at 36, Simmons courted the spotlight until his abrupt and wordless departure from it in 2014.
Catalano insists his client isn't retired: ""He hasn't officially announced his retirement,"" he said.
Simmons has been quiet since posting a heartfelt goodbye on his website and Facebook page in November when Slimmons closed.
Johnny Carson managed to maintain a low profile and general public invisibility after his retirement in 1992, though some speculated that his health was failing. Gene Hackman quietly retired from acting more than a decade ago and switched to writing novels, yet no one made a fuss about it.
But in this Instagram world, the public expects daily — sometimes hourly — updates from their favourite celebs. When , there was a media vigil for her next post, which came weeks later.

After three years of reclusion, the clamour around Simmons has never been louder. The popularity of the podcast has spawned a flood of mostly positive letters and emails, Catalano said. ""You get the one-tenth of one per cent that says he owes his public.""
""I understand why people are confounded,"" Catalano said. ""I'm personally conflicted about it because I know the incredible reception he would get if he wanted to re-emerge in some way, and yet I understand that he may not want to. I get both sides of it.""
Stars should be free to set some boundaries of privacy and accessibility, Catalano said. A journalist's responsibility is to ""tell the story as sensitively and with as much as deference to that public figure as you can,"" said Heyman, recalling Harry Benson's famous 1976 photo of the reclusive Garbo in a swimming cap.
Though Catalano doesn't say so directly, it sounds like he expects Simmons to return at some point.
""When Frank Sinatra sang , that was his goodbye song. And Frank got bored and he was back for 20 years,"" Catalano said.
He said he was talking with Simmons on Tuesday afternoon about ""what he feels; what he wants to do or say, if anything, at this time. It may be nothing right now. We shall see.""
""Look, it's not like he's missing,"" Catalano said.
""He's not ill. He's not 350 pounds. I was with him a few days ago. It's not like I don't know where he is. I know exactly where he is, believe me. And I understand, people don't want to hear it from me, they want to hear it from him, and when he's ready, you will. You'll hear from him.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/richard-simmons-podcast-1.4035985?cmp=rss

The Magnetic North Theatre Festival — which showcases and promotes Canadian theatre nationally and abroad — was scheduled to take place this summer at various venues in the capital, including the National Arts Centre from June 16-24.
""It's been an extremely difficult decision for us knowing what the impact would be on employees, the artists' community at large, donors, our funders and the National Art Centre,"" said Mike Hawkes, chairman of the festival's board.
In a statement released Wednesday, the festival said it incurred a total deficit of over $460,000 for the 2010 and 2011 fiscal years, which created financial pressures in the years that followed.



""We've been since grappling with that deficit while doing — I think — a tremendous delivery of productions of theatre in Ottawa and across the country,"" said Hawkes.
The festival's annual budget is approximately $1 million. In their release they said while they managed to reduce their ""...accumulated deficit to $224,000 through surpluses in each but one of the successive years, [the festival] is now facing a forecast cash deficit of over $150,000 for this season....[and] to proceed with the festival, absorb the cash flow and provide some continuity for next year would require $250,000.""
The National Arts Centre, which has hosted the festival in alternating years and has provided Magnetic North with use of its stages and office space for free, was disappointed by the announcement. 
""We really believe the Magnetic North Theatre Festival was an essential artistic organization to the country,"" said Rosemary Thompson, the NAC's director of communications.
""It was founded in 2003 to be an annual get-together of theatre professionals and presenters — the people who program theatre across the country — to see the very best work from across the country so they could pick wonderful shows to take everywhere in Canada,"" said Thompson.
""We think it's incredibly unfortunate that this has happened.""
Thompson said NAC officials recently brought together different public funders to see what could be done, but in the end the festival's board of directors felt that the financial challenges were too great to overcome.
""Last week we forgave their [$42,000] debt to us, and we thought that would help but apparently there was more than that,"" she said.


Hawkes said while the deficit placed incredible pressures on the festival this year, the financial challenges were compounded by other issues.

Two senior staff members left and were replaced, and a major source of income disappeared. 
""One grant that we really needed to keep us going here did not come through,"" said Hawkes.
The major public funders of the festival have been the department of Canadian Heritage, the Ontario Arts Council, the Canada Council for the Arts and the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency. The City of Ottawa has never funded the festival.
According to the festival's release, Magnetic North had also faced challenges fundraising money and had ""...engaged two consultants last summer to develop strategies to increase its revenues through individual donations and corporate sponsorship.""

Although Hawkes admits the closing of the festival will leave a gap in Canada's theatre community, he is hopeful others will step in to create a space for new, emerging work to thrive.
""We're hoping that the [arts] community will rally and find another way to continue the legacy of Magnetic North,"" said Hawkes.
​""Magnetic North Theatre Festival is not just an opportunity to produce and deliver plays to audiences in Ottawa,"" he added. It's also an opportunity for the industry to gather...from Canada and around the world. We've had tremendous success over time with getting Canadian theatre into European theatre festivals.""
Thompson also agrees that closing the festival will have an impact on Canada's theatre landscape.
""Anyone who loves theatre in this country has seen shows that have been programmed by Magnetic North,"" she said.
""A talent scout from Edmonton or Saskatoon or St. John's sees it at Magnetic North and programs it the following season. That's how Canadian theatre is being discovered and how it's being programmed,"" said Thompson.
""Our hearts go out to the artists.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/the-magnetic-north-theatre-festival-cancels-its-2017-season-1.4037200?cmp=rss

""I never would have guessed that it went on even three years, let alone going into an 11th year,""  told  on Wednesday.



""I think it resonates with a lot of families in Canada and all over the world. They can sit down together as a family and watch  and they don't have to worry about the content. They know it is going to be wholesome and good for the whole family.""
Marshall, while not born in the west, has set down roots in Alberta as a result of the production.

""I really think that I have embraced the western culture. I grew up around horses back in Ontario but I never knew the extent of it until I came out here. I saw the cowboy way and I saw just how much of an impact horses have on some of the ranchers and people in this area,"" she explained.

""I moved out here. I bought a ranch. I have horses and cattle and all kinds of things, so it has really helped me to play my character to the fullest.""
Marshall says one of the keys to success for the show is its ability to evolve.



""I love the fact that  has no limitations to our ability to live and learn and grow. I think a lot of television series that are trapped in a high school environment or a certain environment where the characters aren't allowed to grow up — it's harder for them, and it's harder for the writers to be able to find new stories,"" she said.
""But on , we are allowed to develop into young adults, and then get married, and have kids and go through a natural life process. And so I think that is one of the reasons for the longevity of the show as well.""

If you can find work that doesn't feel like work, do it, Marshall says.





""Every day I wake up, and I go out and I feed my horses and I take a deep breath and I say 'Oh, I love this life,'"" she explained.

""And then I drive to work and do the same thing all over again, so it's just an incredible experience for me to be able to do what I love, every day.""

Publisher Pan Macmillan said Dexter died Tuesday at his home in Oxford, southern England.
Macmillan publisher Jeremy Trevathan said Dexter ""represented the absolute epitome of British crime writing.""
""With Colin's death there has been a tectonic shift in the international crime writing scene,"" he said.
Crime writer Ian Rankin tweeted that Dexter was ""a gentle man with a steel mind; and the creator of such an iconic character.""
Born in 1930 in Stamford, central England, Dexter studied classics at Cambridge University and became a teacher, examiner and textbook author before turning to fiction. He began writing a detective novel to help pass the time during a wet vacation in Wales.
, published in 1975, introduced Morse, a detective with a love of real ale, classical music and crosswords — and for a long time, no first name, at least not one disclosed to readers.
In the 1996 novel his given name was revealed to be Endeavour.
Morse, accompanied by the trustworthy Sgt. Lewis, solved murders and mysteries in the ancient English university city in 13 novels until Dexter killed him off in ""The Remorseful Day"" in 1999.
Some fans were distraught to see Morse go.
""I get letters from people who are very fed up and say they are not going to forgive me,"" Dexter said the following year. ""But he's been with me for 27 years and I'm going to miss him more than anybody.""
Dexter shared his hero's affection for good beer, classical music and crossword puzzles, but by all accounts lacked his prickly nature.
Maria Rejt, Dexter's editor at Macmillan, said he would be remembered for ""his loyalty, modesty and self-deprecating humour.""
""His was the sharpest mind and the biggest heart, and his wonderful novels and stories will remain a testament to both,"" Rejt said.
Dexter acknowledged that his characters would be ""a miserable sod if you took him to a pub.""
""He would never pay for a beer, which would rank in many people's minds as a worse sin than adultery,"" the writer told the Associated Press in 1997.
But, Dexter added, ""he has many likable traits. He has got a sense of justice and fair play. I think he's vulnerable and sensitive.""
Morse was played — to perfection, in the eyes of many — by the late John Thaw in a successful TV version that ran from 1987 to 2000. Dexter made uncredited cameo appearances in many of the 33 episodes, which fans took delight in spotting.
He continued the practice in two television spinoffs: , which centred on Morse's former sidekick; and, which showed the beginning of Morse's career in the 1960s.
Kevin Lygo, director of television at broadcaster ITV, said the network ""is very grateful to Colin for bringing so much joy to the audience over the years, and the world of Inspector E. Morse will live forever.""
In 2000, Dexter was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to literature.
He said at the time that if Morse really existed, he ""would probably say to me, 'Well, you didn't do me too bad a service in your writing.'
""He might say, 'I wish you'd made me a slightly less miserable blighter and slightly more generous, and you could have painted me in a little bit of a better light.""'",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/colin-dexter-author-obit-1.4037271?cmp=rss

Yulia Samoylova, who was to represent Russia in the May 11-13 contest , was banned by Ukraine's security service because she had toured in Crimea after Russia's 2014 annexation of the peninsula from Ukraine.
Ukrainian law allows the banning of anyone who enters Crimea by routes other than over the de-facto border with the Ukrainian mainland. Most Russians go to Crimea by ferry or air.
Ukrainian Security Service spokeswoman Olena Gitlanska said on her Facebook page that the service has banned Samoylova from the country for three years ""on the basis of information received about her violation of Ukrainian law.""

The reaction from Moscow was swift and furious.
""This is yet another openly cynical and inhuman act by the authorities in Kyiv,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin told the state news agency Tass.
""Kyiv, apparently, was seriously frightened by a fragile girl,"" a Foreign Ministry statement said, apparently referring to the 27-year-old's use of a wheelchair.
Tensions between Moscow and Kyiv have been high since  and the beginning that year of a Russia-backed separatist insurgency in east Ukraine that has killed nearly 10,000 people.

The Samoylova ban adds fuel to the fire partly because of her disability; she has used a wheelchair since childhood.
""The UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities should discuss this as it is a violation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,"" Diana Gurtskaya, a blind singer who represented Georgia at Eurovision in 2008, was quoted as saying by Tass.
The European Broadcasting Union, which organizes Eurovision, said in a statement that it would negotiate with Ukraine on Samoylova's entry.

Barris died of natural causes at age 87 on Tuesday afternoon at his home in Palisades, N.Y, according to publicist Paul Shefrin, who announced the death on behalf of Barris's family.
Barris created a number of game shows, hitting it big with ,  and , which he hosted.
In the 1984 book, he said that between his high-profile gigs throughout his career he was a paid hitman for the CIA.
After many fits and starts in Hollywood, the book was turned into the 2002 motion picture, scripted by Charlie Kaufman, directed by George Clooney and starring Sam Rockwell as Barris.

Barris for the first decade of his showbiz career worked in a variety of jobs, including behind the scenes on Dick Clark's American Bandstand. He also tried his hand at songwriting, with Freddy Cannon taking his to No. 3 on the U.S. pop chart in 1962.
 debuted in 1965 on ABC, with contestants grilling three prospective suitors on their likes and dislikes, filled with suggestive questions and double entendres. , was the original host.
The first run lasted eight years, but the show was revived on other occasions into the 1990s. The likes of Tom Selleck, Suzanne Somers and Steve Martin were among a number of future celebrities who appeared as contestants. So did Rodney Alcala, who, it was learned years later, was a serial killer who had already murdered victims by the time of his 1978 appearance on the show.
, hosted by Bob Eubanks, began its run a year after the, and was also a long-running success. The barbed humour remained, with the show featuring married couples who quite often didn't know each other very well.

Barris decided to take a turn in front of the camera with  in 1976, his most divisive successful show. The show featured amateur talent acts, often atrocious, who tried to avoid the gong of celebrity judges.
It was patterned after the Major Bowes Amateur Hour, a radio hit in the 1930s, with the gong the show's equivalent of vaudeville's hook. The victims would then be mercilessly berated by the often manic Barris.
Regular acts included Gene the Dancing Machine and the paper-bagged Unknown Comic, who in reality was Canadian standup Murray Langston.
The show courted controversy on more than one occasion, including 1978's Have You Got a Nickel act, which consisted entirely of two teenaged girls licking popsicles, a segment that never aired in the Central and Pacific time zones. In another incident, judge Jaye P. Morgan flashed the audience.
He revelled in the attention but critics branded him ""The King of Schlock"" or ""The Baron of Bad Taste.""
By early 1980, Chuck Barris Productions boasted revenues of over $30 million US, according to a New York Times article, but that was around the time his TV empire had started to fade.
Recent offerings had been failures, including , which lampooned pageants, and , described by one TV writer as ""the sleazy game show that tried to find out if wives or secretaries knew a businessman best.""
That year, the  was expectedly a critical failure, but also a commercial flop.
Barris sold his company for a reported $100 million.
Barris would write five other books, including the 2007 satirical novel, in which game show contestants experience the ultimate extremes depending on their answers, and the 2010 remembrance , about his only child, who died at age 36 in 1998 after battling drug addiction.
Born in Philadelphia in 1929, Charles Barris was left destitute, along with his sister and their mother, when his dentist father died of a stroke. He graduated from the Drexel Institute of Technology in 1953 before embarking on his strange, successful career.

Kennedy, who was born and raised in Ottawa, died on Monday, according to a statement from her family.
Kennedy's interviewing ease charmed audiences but she said her career in broadcasting actually came about by fluke. She got her start at the Ottawa Citizen, working on the newspaper. When the paper's staff went on strike, she was asked to host a radio show in an effort to keep subscribers from fleeing.

CFRB, the talk radio station in Toronto, took notice and she soon made the jump to the city to host her own program: . That's where she developed her signature interviewing style — posing a question and just letting her interview subjects talk. And they liked it.
During an interview on the show with American architect Buckminster Fuller, he told Kennedy: ""I don't think I recall a conversation where anybody has been quite as logically sensitive as you are about these questions you ask.""
Bob Rae, former Liberal leader and Ontario premier, told CBC News Tuesday that Kennedy prepared meticulously for her interviews, calling her an ""icon of Canadian journalism.""
""She was always extremely polite and thoughtful. And she had a huge listenership and anybody in politics or public life at that time, that's the show you wanted to be on.""

In the show's 27 years, Kennedy got to talk to 25,000 guests, from celebrities and politicians to community builders.
She recalled her beginnings  ""It's very much a sink or swim business. If you're lucky enough to get in, you're really on your own."" He commended her on her interviewing style and the questions she chose to ask. Kennedy compared it to everyday life.
""Your own mind and your own curiosity is often the best guide, I think, on what you ask. If you're curious about something, chances are somebody else is too,"" Kennedy responded.

But it was her appearances as a panellist on CBC-TV's that's she's perhaps best known for. She started with the show in 1962 and lasted until its cancellation in 1995. The show saw panellists try to 
There she was paired with famed journalists like Pierre Berton and Gordon Sinclair, something she found intimidating at first. She said she was ""scared to death"" to start, but soon found that both men weren't that ""frightening at all.""

The show's one-time producer Don Brown once said she was a perfect fit: ""She has class. She's a very experienced journalist. She brought dignity, a femininity, a cool, controlled intelligence.""
Her work earned her spots in both the Canadian Broadcasting Hall of Fame and the Canadian News Hall of Fame and in 1982, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

""She was always classy and elegant in the way she went about her business and was adored by her fans. Broadcasting and journalism lost a leading lady with her passing.""



She was a longtime Liberal supporter; former prime minister Jean Chrétien , at age 74. Since the mandatory retirement age is 75, she spent less than a year there. Chrétien defended her older age appointment at the time, telling reporters she brought lots of experience to the job.

They hang out and use their brute strength — their mass and energy — to keep all the stars and planets in their galaxy in line. But every once in a while, a star wanders a bit too close. When that happens, it's lights out for the star.
About 290 million years ago, a supermassive black hole in a distant galaxy shredded a sun-like star and swallowed it. Now scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are coming to understand why.

Black holes are objects in the universe of unimaginable mass and energy, and they have such strong gravitational forces that nothing, not even light, can escape. These black holes, especially supermassive ones, exert such a force on the surrounding objects — planets, stars and everything else — that it keeps galaxies together. But sometimes a star can wander a bit too close. When that happens, it will get pulled towards the black hole, eventually crossing the event horizon, the place where nothing can ever escape.
Now, when a star gets swallowed, it doesn't go down without a fight: it will release an intense amount of energy, called a tidal disruption force, that can be seen across the universe.


When a star wanders too close to a black hole the whole event results in a bright spot in the sky. One night in November 2014, there was a bright point observed by space telescope SWIFT. Shortly after, a program called ASAS-SN (All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae) run by The Ohio State University's Department of Astronomy realized the significance of this bright point, and it caught the attention of Dheeraj Pasham at MIT.
""They [SWIFT and ASAS-SN] take images of this part of the sky, [they see] there was nothing there yesterday, they come back today and all of a sudden there's like a bright point-source there, so, you know, it's pretty obvious that something happened in the sky at that location,"" said Pasham. 
And it's from that blob that NASA's SWIFT space telescope, as well as others on Earth, started to really train their eye on that part of the sky and measure all sorts of different types of radiation coming from that spot — everything from radio to infrared to X-rays in the electromagnetic spectrum.




One thing that was remarkable about the tidal disruption flare was different telescopes detected a signal from all across the electromagnetic spectrum. It's rare to have that much data from that many different sources. That data allowed Pasham and colleagues to really dig into the mechanics of what happens when a star gets swallowed by a black hole.
""We looked at about a year-long of the monitoring data, in the X-ray wave band, and also in the optical and UV wave band, and what we found was that there was these brightness fluctuations in the optical and the UV that repeated themselves in the X-ray band about thirty days after they appear in the optical and UV band,"" said Pasham. ""This was telling us that the optical UV imaging region was physically distinct from the X-ray imaging region, and we know that X-rays must be coming from very close to the black hole, so now we had a reference that the UV optical emanating sites are roughly thirty days away from the black hole.""

What that means is that the sun-like star was getting pulled apart and literally shredded into a debris stream that spiralled around the centre of this black hole. 
It's like a penny swirling around one of those columnar toys at science centres, where it spirals closer and closer and faster and faster towards the centre where it disappears forever. That's exactly what is happening here, but the forces are so strong, the velocities so fast, that something as big as a star is getting ripped apart while it swirls to its death. And the debris is getting flung out into space while the bulk of the sun swirls closer and closer to the centre of the black hole.


Not that often, which is why this particular detection was so lucky. It is estimated that this type of event happens only once every 100,000 years in a galaxy.
In fact, in 2014, the supermassive black hole in the centre of our own Milky Way galaxy was getting a little hungry. There was a star that seemed to get perilously close and astronomers were waiting with baited breath for it to be engulfed. But, for whatever reason it never happened. 
Why these events occur is still unclear. Is it some wobble or disruption in the gravitational field? Is it something that comes from the black hole or other parts of the universe?  We simply don't know. But now, with this data, we understand more about the forces underlying this behaviour and now understand more about black holes which have always been impossible to detect.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/if-you-re-a-hungry-black-hole-try-snacking-on-a-star-1.4037628?cmp=rss

""Being able to play that with my friends and not have a disability hinder my playthrough, it was amazing,"" said Steve Saylor, a blind gamer from Toronto.
He said the 1-2 Switch contains unique features that make it possible for him to play. 
""The text was really big on screen. I can sort of stand back and read it without any problems. And for them to describe things in audio on how to play certain games is really great,"" he said.
Saylor has a condition called nystagmus which causes involuntary eye movement and makes it hard for his eyes to focus.

His vision is severely impaired — even with glasses on, something that's six metres away looks like it's 60 metres away. 
When he plays video games, he stands just over half-a-metre away from a big-screen TV.
Saylor likes to play story-based games such as the massively popular The Last of Us, Witcher 3 and Mass Effect. Role-playing games usually move at a slower pace and don't rely a lot on hand-eye coordination, Saylor said.


""Anything that's like an Assassin's Creed or a Skyrim where essentially it's a lot of text and a lot of complex movements that you have to make, it's hard for me to get through…because I don't have that eye-hand co-ordination that other people do,"" he said.
He likes first-person shooters such as Call of Duty and Battlefield.
Even if he's not particularly good at a game, he will still post his playthrough to his  as part of a series he calls Blind Gamer. His channel is meant to show that blind people can play video games, too.

Saylor said he likes playing mainstream games as opposed to audio games, which are targeted to blind and visually impaired people, because he can play mainstream games with or alongside his friends. 

""It levels the playing field and it allows for a small moment in time for someone with a visual disability to actually kind of feel normal in a way,"" he said.
""Not to say that we're not normal, but it allows us to feel like we're gamers, too. We want to be able to play these games. I really hope developers can see that and develop that further.""

Electronic Arts, one of the world's largest gaming companies, is working on incorporating accessible features in its games. This would help the roughly half a million Canadians and 25 million Americans who have significant vision loss.


Karen Stevens, an engineer for Madden NFL, has recently taken on the role of an accessibility advocate for EA. She's the one responsible for the accessibility features in Madden. 

In her role, she reaches out to visually impaired gamers to find out how to make their games more inclusive. 



""We have brightness and contrast support to help people with low vision. In the same line we also added in a resize feature so icons on the field — like pass icons — catch icons were about twice as tall and twice as wide as an option so people could see them easier,"" she said.

The reason EA is doing this is simple, she said: The company wants people to be able to play the games it makes.

As for the future of accessible games, Saylor said virtual reality may be a good option for visually impaired and blind gamers.

The first time he tried virtual reality was also the first time he was able to play a video game without his glasses because the screen was so close to his face. 

""It makes it so much easier, more accessible. That's kind of where accessibility can be pushed, and I hope that it can be pushed in that direction,"" Saylor said.
One company that has successfully created an inclusive VR experience is The Campfire Union in Winnipeg. 
Campfire created a 360-degree video for the Canadian Museum for Human Rights that brings viewers into two women's co-operatives in Guatemala.
The video was closed-captioned, bilingual and tested to make items in the video distinguishable for those who are colour blind.
It also featured hands-free navigation that's equivalent to a mouse pointer, so viewers could select items in the video just by staring at them.  



These are the kinds of features John Luxford, chief technology officer at The Campfire Union, hopes to see in the future. 
Virtual reality is still in its infancy and has no real standards to dictate things like how players need to interact with items or how they should move around, he said.
""This gives us an opportunity to look at inclusiveness and look at accessibility right off the hop and design those things deliberately and from the start,"" Luxford said. 
""I think what will happen is for the next few years it's probably going to be somewhat of a Wild West, and you're not going to see a lot of commonality between things. Then standards will start to emerge. And I'm hoping one of those is a strong emphasis on inclusiveness.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/blind-video-gamers-1.4037944?cmp=rss

The spreading boycott confronts Google with a challenge that threatens to cost it hundreds of millions of dollars.

YouTube's popularity stems from its massive and eclectic library of video, spanning everything from polished TV clips to raw diatribes posted by people bashing homosexuals.
But that diverse selection periodically allows ads to appear next to videos that marketers find distasteful, despite Google's efforts to prevent it from happening.
Google depends largely on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute.

Earlier this week, Google vowed to step up its efforts to block ads on ""hateful, offensive and derogatory"" videos.
""We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us,"" Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, wrote in a Tuesday blog post.
As part of Google's solution to the problem, Schindler promised to hire ""significant numbers"" of employees to review YouTube videos and flag them as inappropriate for ads. He also predicted YouTube would be able to address advertisers' concerns through Google's recent advancements in artificial intelligence — technology parlance for computers that learn to think like humans.
But that promise so far hasn't appeased AT&amp;T, Verizon Communications and an expanding global list of advertisers that includes Volkswagen, Audi, HSBC Holdings, the Royal Bank of Scotland and L'Oreal.
""We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,"" AT&amp;T said in a statement. ""Until Google can ensure this won't happen again, we are removing our ads from Google's non-search platforms.""

By extending its ban to everything beyond Google's search results, AT&amp;T is also effectively pulling its ads from more than two million other websites that depend on Google to deliver ads to their pages.
In its statement, Verizon said it decided to pull ads from YouTube to protect its website while it investigates the ""weak links"" among its digital advertising partners.
Both AT&amp;T and Verizon may have an ulterior motive to make YouTube look like an untrustworthy spot for marketers because both companies are trying to sell more digital ads in their own networks.
YouTube has become one of the fastest growing parts of Google's ad system, which generated $79 billion US in revenue last year. Google doesn't disclose how much of that came from YouTube ads, but the research firm eMarketer estimated that the video site accounted for $5.6 billion of that amount. EMarketer projected YouTube's advertising will rise 26 per cent this year to $7 billion, but that prediction came before marketers began to suspend their spending.
The YouTube boycott began late last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in videos delving into contentious themes.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/google-youtube-videos-ads-1.4037468?cmp=rss

Scientists on Wednesday proposed a radical overhaul of the dinosaur family tree first laid out in 1888, concluding after an analysis of 75 species that the meat-eating group that includes T. rex should not be lumped in with the long-necked, long-tailed, four-legged plant-eaters like Brontosaurus.

The proposed new family tree includes two reformulated categories, or clades, of dinosaurs to replace the two that paleontologists have long recognized. The research also pushes dinosaur origins back to relatively soon after a mass extinction that rocked the Earth 252 million years ago.
""We may be proved to be correct, we may not,"" said University of Cambridge paleontologist Matthew Baron, who led the research published in the journal Nature.
""But what has to happen now is a complete abandonment of old dogmatic views across the field because we have shown that rigorous and objective studies can pull apart age-old ideas, and that we as scientists should never get too comfortable with an idea when it can still be tested in new ways.""
Key skeletal differences indicate the meat-eating group called theropods, including giants like T. rex, Allosaurus, Giganotosaurus and Spinosaurus, and the long-necked group called sauropods, including huge Brontosaurus, Diplodocus and Argentinosaurus, should not be banded together, he said.

Scientists long have organized dinosaurs into two clades.
The so-called bird-hipped Ornithischia includes the herbivorous spiky-tailed stegosaurs, tank-like ankylosaurs, horned dinosaurs, duckbills and dome-headed dinosaurs. The so-called reptile-hipped Saurischia covered theropods including birds and the sauropods.

Baron proposed two newly devised categories. The first, called Ornithoscelida, joins the theropods with all the current members of Ornithischia. The current Saurischia group would lose the theropods but add a strange, primitive group of two-legged carnivores called herrerasaurids.
The analysis placed the earliest dinosaur at 242 to 247 million years ago, a small Tanzanian species called Nyasasaurus. After humble beginnings, dinosaurs become the dominant land animals until an asteroid wiped them out 66 million years ago.
""Our results strongly suggest that the ancestral dinosaur was a quick, two-footed, generalist feeder that would have eaten a mix of plants and meat,"" Baron said.
University of Maryland paleontologist Thomas Holtz, not involved in the study, praised the research, saying, ""There is a very good chance that they are correct, even though it goes against decades of research pointing a different way.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/new-categories-dinosaur-family-tree-1.4036514?cmp=rss

Sea ice around the North Pole expands to its biggest extent of the year in February or March after a deep freeze in the <br /> winter polar darkness and shrinks to the smallest of the year in September, at the end of the brief Arctic summer.

Arctic sea ice appears to have reached its annual maximum extent on March 7, the lowest maximum in the 38-year satellite record, according to the Colorado-based U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center.
On that date, the ice covered 14.42 million square kilometres, 97,000 square kilometres below the previous lowest maximum that occurred on Feb. 25, 2015.
The trend of shrinking ice around the North Pole in recent decades has been one of the starkest signs of climate change.
The thaw is harming Indigenous peoples' hunting livelihoods on the ice and threatening wildlife, such as polar bears. It also makes the region more accessible for shipping as well as oil and gas exploration.


Worldwide, last year was the warmest on record for the third year in a row, despite government efforts to rein in man-made greenhouse gas emissions under a 2015 Paris Agreement that aims to phase out the use of fossil fuels this century.
Earlier on Wednesday, scientists at the University of Bremen in Germany published similar findings. Their data showed that the ice covered just 14.49 million square kilometres on Feb. 22, almost the size of Russia, fractionally smaller than the previous winter low of 14.58 million square kilometres set last year in satellite records dating back to the 1970s.
""We've passed the winter maximum,"" Georg Heygster, of the Institute of Environmental Physics at the University of Bremen told Reuters. Only a sudden, unusual March freeze would push the ice back to above the February extent.
Sea ice in the Arctic could vanish by 2050 on a trend of rising emissions, according to a UN panel of climate experts.
At the other end of the world, sea ice around Antarctica hit a record low for the southern summer last month, the NSIDC said.
The shrinking sea ice exposes more water to the sun's rays in summertime. That can accelerate global warming because dark blue water soaks up more of the sun's heat than white ice or snow, which reflects it back into space.

""Up until now, within the bulk of Alberta, the large hibernacula we have found are in the Rocky Mountains, so it's nice to find that this is the third-largest known ... in the province,"" Dave Critchley of the Wildlife Conservation Society's Bat Caver program told  on Wednesday.

That makes it  observed to date.

""There may be others that we haven't stumbled upon yet.""


The society isn't sharing the exact location but it's in Alberta's Northern Boreal Forest, about an hour's helicopter ride from the nearest town.

""It's been known for a long time to the local First Nations folks, it has a spiritual significance to the local groups and it's in a protected area within the Alberta government's realm,"" said Critchley.


It's a valuable find for researchers studying the devastating white-nose syndrome, which can wipe out a bat population and has been observed in Eastern Canada and .

""It decimates populations, anywhere from 90 to 99 per cent of a population,"" Critchley explained.



The discovery of this population could be invaluable from a research standpoint.
""We need to know where they are if there is ever a large scale treatment that we can apply,"" he said.

""It helps us know that there is a healthy population in the Northern Boreal Forest.""


And they've also learned that hibernation isn't as black and white as previously thought.

""There is some motion, some mobility,"" Critchley said.

""A couple of them are adventuring to the entrance to see if it's warm enough, are there insects, coming back to the group and going back to sleep. We are seeing a lot more dynamics than what we historically understood the bats were doing.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/bat-cave-discovered-northern-alberta-1.4037307?cmp=rss

But researchers at the University of Oxford in the U.K.  a computer program called Watch, Attend and Spell to do just that.



They claim their lip-reading algorithm is more accurate than human professionals.
Dan Misener is our tech columnist.


There are a number of reasons you might want a computer to lip-read and many of those have to do with accessibility.
For instance, a lip-reading computer could transcribe or add captions to video, make it easier for people to talk to their devices in noisy environments, or fill in the gaps during a video conference.
But, as it turns out, lip-reading is a difficult task for both humans and computers.
That's because our mouths often make the same shapes for different words, according to Joon Son Chung, one of the researchers at Oxford.
""So, for example, pat, bat and mat are visually identical,"" Chung said.  
If you only see a mouth and don't hear a voice, it's very difficult to tell the different between ""bat"" and ""mat.""
That's the challenge of getting a computer to lip-read.
But the reason we're talking about this today is that there have been several recent improvements in this field.
And in some cases, computers can now lip-read better than humans.


The researchers created what they call . It's a new artificial intelligence software system.

Watch, Attend and Spell was created using an approach known as machine learning. The researchers created an algorithm — a neural network — that could learn over time.
They trained the algorithm by showing it thousands of hours of TV news footage from BBC.
The advantage of TV news is that it's relatively high-quality video and it includes lots of different faces and speaking styles.
Plus, the TV shows they used to train the algorithm were already captioned by professionals. So they could match the mouth movements to transcriptions of what had been said on-screen.

After the researchers trained their algorithm on these thousands of hours of TV, they put it to the test in the real world to see how it would perform on video without captions.
In other words, they wanted to see if their software could take what it had learned, and lip-read faces and mouths that it hadn't necessarily seen before.


It was surprisingly accurate.
It was able to get about 50 per cent of the words right.
Now, 50 per cent accuracy doesn't sound all that impressive until you compare it with human lip-reading experts. 
""We have given the same clips to the professional lip-readers and they seem to get less than one-quarter right,"" Chung said. 
So, the computer's performance is pretty impressive.


When I first heard about this research, my mind immediately turned to that scene in , where they reveal that the HAL 9000 computer can lip-read.
I thought about all the cameras in the world around us that are constantly capturing video, such as smartphone cameras or security cameras.
If it's possible to figure out what someone is saying using only an image of their mouth, the possibilities for surveillance and eavesdropping seem pretty creepy.
I asked Chung about this, and he told me that the system doesn't pose a serious privacy risk right now.
That's partly because most security cameras aren't high-quality enough to make this type of lip-reading work.
He also pointed out the software's 50 per cent accuracy rate.
""Yes, it's true, it can lip-read better than a human, but it still gets half the words wrong when used without the audio. So it's not really useful for privacy intrusive scenarios,"" Chung said. 
Even if you got a clear, high-resolution video feed of someone, you couldn't know for certain exactly what they were saying.

Like I said off the top, the researchers had accessibility in mind when designing this system. 
In particular, they thought about applications that could help people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.
This technology also has the potential to significantly improve general-purpose speech recognition as well.
I don't know about you, but I'm often frustrated when I use voice-based services like Siri, or Google Now or Alexa. Sometimes they work well for me, but other times, these voice assistants get things very wrong.

The researchers at Oxford believe that by combining voice recognition with lip-reading technology, that could dramatically improve the accuracy of these virtual assistants.
And there's another thing to consider: we tend to think of understanding speech as an auditory skill. But humans also pick up on visual cues to understand what's being said. 
In that way, when we combine speech recognition technology with lip-reading technology, we're building computer systems that mirror how humans perceive speech.
And if that can help Siri understand me a little better, that's a bonus.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/lip-reading-program-helps-accessibility-1.4034565?cmp=rss

As the world demands more and more of our most precious resource, and sources seem to be drying up, the UN says there is a huge untapped reservoir that could help to meet the demand: wastewater.
The UN estimates that the amount of wastewater produced annually is about , six times more water than exists in all the rivers of the world. Of that, only four per cent is treated to advanced levels. The rest is dumped back into the environment raw.

In developing countries, it often ends up back in the very source people use for drinking, causing disease, plagues and pestilence. In richer countries, effluent from wastewater treatment plants may contain a whole cocktail of hormones, pharmaceuticals and other drugs that pass through our bodies, while industrial waste can contain heavy metals and other toxins. But if this water was treated properly, it becomes a valuable source of water that be used for non-drinking purposes, such as for washing the car, street cleaning, industrial processes and some household uses. Even the energy from the wastewater can be captured to heat buildings.  

It is a simple fact that people are demanding more water from Earth, yet the planet is not making any more of it, and that is not sustainable. Since 1993, the United Nations has tried to focus the world's attention on water conservation and preservation from pollution. But this year's focus is on a huge supply of water that is literally slipping through our fingers.

A report called """" outlines success stories around the world where cities have repurposed wastewater for agriculture and other activities, as well as public misconceptions and political barriers that stand in the way of wastewater recycling.
It makes much more sense to save the pure potable water for human consumption, then recycle wastewater for everything else. Toilets, lawns and gardens don't need pure water. Nor is it needed for heating and cooling purposes. Wastewater even contains nutrients that are beneficial for non-food agriculture.

Our cities go to great expense to ensure our drinking water is safe. In the household, a lot of that pure water has a useful lifetime of less than one second as it drops from the tap to the drain, then another expensive network takes over to remove whatever we dumped into it. That's a lot of trouble to go through to make sure that water is clean. And we use a lot of it. , we are one of the highest consumers of water in the world, gulping down about 250 litres per person per day. If you include the water we use for cleaning, washing and energy production, it goes even higher. Compare that to Africa where the average consumption is about 10 litres per day, and people there usually have to travel some distance to get it.

The technology to recycle domestic wastewater already , with grey water systems that link sinks to filter systems then up to your toilet or to a rain barrel so the water can be used for outdoor purposes.
Of course, there is work to be done before the public will fully buy into this idea. There will be extra pressure on wastewater treatment facilities to ensure the public that harmful contaminants such as pathogens, pharmaceuticals and heavy metals have been removed. That will mean extra costs, but when you consider the costs of building new dams to create reservoirs, or drilling for new sources of clean water, investing in treatment plants upgrades could end up costing a lot less.

The idea or recycling water is not new. Nature has been doing it for more than three billion years. That is one of the most remarkable aspects of water. Every time it evaporates into the sky, it leaves contaminants behind, then eventually fall as clean rain. Thanks to that water cycle, Earth has been able to support life by continually recycling it back into fresh supplies. In other words, the water you drink today has already been through a dinosaur.
Over the last ten thousand years, since we humans decided to live in towns, getting rid of waste has been a constant problem, costing millions of lives through the spread of disease. Our water supplies seem to be running low because we keep taking from the source. Now it's time to turn our attention to another huge source, the water we throw away.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/waste-world-water-day-1.4030595?cmp=rss
d7ca76a3377a74f876925197e2b3ea2bb006292f,Reuters,2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,Earthquakes could cause Los Angeles area to sink abruptly: study,"The Big One may be overdue to hit California, but scientists near Los Angeles have found a new risk for the area during a major earthquake: abrupt sinking of land, potentially below sea level.
The last known major quake on the San Andreas fault occurred in 1857, but three quakes over the last 2,000 years on nearby faults made ground just outside Los Angeles city limits sink as much as one metre, according to a  published Monday in the journal Scientific Reports.

Seismologists estimate the 1,287 kilometre-long San Andreas, which runs most of the length of the state, should see a large quake roughly every 150 years.
Scientists from California State University Fullerton and the United States Geological Survey found evidence the older quakes caused part of the coastline south of Long Beach to drop by one-and-a-half to three feet.

Today that could result in the area ending up at or below sea level, said Cal State Fullerton professor Matt Kirby, who worked with the paper's lead author, graduate student Robert Leeper.
""It's something that would happen relatively instantaneously,"" Kirby said. ""Probably today if it happened, you would see seawater rushing in.""
The study was limited to a roughly 2.5-square-kilometre area inside the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge, near the Newport-Inglewood and Rose Canyon faults. Kirby acknowledged that the exact frequency of events on the faults is unclear, as is the risk that another quake will occur in the near future.
The smallest of the historic earthquakes was likely more intense than the strongest on record in the area, the magnitude 6.3 Long Beach earthquake of 1933, which killed 120 people and caused the inflation-adjusted equivalent of nearly $1 billion US in damage.
Today, the survey site is sandwiched by the cities of Huntington Beach and Long Beach, home to over 600,000 people, while nearby Los Angeles County has a population of 10 million.
Seismologist John Vidale, head of the University of Washington-based Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, said after reviewing the study he was skeptical such powerful quakes could occur very frequently in the area.
Kirby noted that the team could only collect soil core samples within the relatively undisturbed refuge, and that taking deeper samples would shed light on the seismic record even further back, potentially giving scientists more examples of similar quakes to work from.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/earthquakes-sinking-los-angeles-1.4035943?cmp=rss
67c4bf08b8b4fc02bf70cdd7ef0a6dcbf0b5b6e0,Murray Brewster,2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,"Canada, NATO attempt to define boundaries of response to cyberattacks","Military planners in both Ottawa and Brussels are wrestling with the notion that keystrokes are as much of a threat as Kalashnikovs in this summer's deployment of the Canadian-led NATO battle group to Latvia.
They are weighing how to respond to a significant cyberattack on the Baltic nation, one that would target civilian, rather than military infrastructure in a manner similar to the one that took down government agencies and banks in Estonia in 2007.
A few weeks ago Canada's chief of defence staff pledged a sizable contingent of so-called cyber warriors would be part of the deployment.
But how far they will be able to go in countering cyber and information warfare threats coming from Russia is still a matter of debate.​
""To the best of my knowledge, our [rules of engagement] are still under development, certainly from a cyber perspective,"" said Brig.-Gen. Paul Rutherford, commander of the military's Joint Forces Cyber Component. ""I must leave it there.""
But he underlined there is no intention on the part of NATO or Canada to conduct offensive online operations against hackers, state-sponsored or otherwise.

And there will be clear rules before the 450 Canadian troops depart, Rutherford said.
""It will be a strong, defensive cyber posture,"" he told CBC News in a recent interview. ""We will work closely with our allies, with our battle group partners, and to include the Latvians.""
Getting the rules just right is crucial from both a military and political perspective, say defence experts.
Two years ago, NATO placed massive cyberattacks on member nations on the same level as those conducted with bullets and ballistic missiles. The notion was reinforced at last summer's summit among the alliance's 28 leaders in Warsaw, Poland.
""NATO is ready for the Allies to invoke collective defence in response to a significant cyberattack, the equivalent of an armed attack through cyberspace,"" officials said at the time.

But defining specifically what the threshold is for a ""significant cyberattack,"" when it triggers the alliance's self-defence clause — known as Article 5 — and when response moves from the online to the real world is a matter of debate.
The deliberation is made more important by the fact that the West is already engaged in an undeclared cyberwar with Russian hackers on a daily basis and the most likely form of attack Canadians will face in Latvia will come from the internet, said Anthony Seaboyer, the director of the Centre for Security, Armed Forces and Society at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ont.
Having a precisely calibrated response is also important because one of the main reasons for the NATO deployment to Latvia and the other Baltic States is to act as deterrence.
Failure to respond to a massive online assault on civilian infrastructure — such the banking system or the power grid — could undermine the alliance's credibility.

But Seaboyer said there's good reason for the hesitation on the part of Canadian and NATO officials.
Hackers can launch cyberattacks off laptops anywhere in the world, cover their tracks and create a haze of deniability — something the Russians did masterfully during the annexation of Crimea.
""You can find the IP address, but how do you prove who was operating the computer at the time?"" Seaboyer said. ""How do you prove who paid the person who was behind the attack? They don't leave their CVs, or a card, for you to know who has hacked.""
That makes the decisions by troops on the ground at NATO headquarters more complicated.
""There are huge problems,"" he said. ""You can't just retaliate by sending a Hellfire missile, or drone strike. You just can't retaliate that way. We don't have a cyber army to send anywhere. And I don't know what a cyber army would look like other than hackers. It's a completely different space.""

The rules and the systems NATO has set up over the decades ""in many cases don't fit to the cyber domain"" because nations can't strengthen their border or buy and aircraft carrier, Seaboyer added.
""The hammer we've had in hand doesn't fit here,"" he said.
NATO's cyber strategy places a lot of emphasis on member countries taking responsibility for defence of their own national computer networks, but NATO defence officials say the alliance is still struggling with how to engage each country.
Canadian cyber technicians deployed with the battle group will naturally guard against intrusions into the military networks, but what they can do for the people they are to protect remains foggy at best.
""If the rules of engagement allow us to be good coalition partners in cyber defence, then we will be so,"" said Rutherford.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-latvia-cyber-1.4035040?cmp=rss

One of many bee types that have suffered steep population declines, the rusty-patched has disappeared from about 90 per cent of its range in the past 20 years. It previously was common across the East Coast and much of the Midwest, where it played a crucial role as a pollinator of crops and wild plants.

Its listing as an endangered species means the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will devise a plan for returning the imperilled bee to ""a healthy and secure condition,"" the U.S. Department of Interior said. ""We will work with stakeholders to ensure collaborative conservation among landowners, farmers, industry and developers in the areas where the species is native.""
The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, which filed the petition that triggered the government's consideration of the matter, said it was ""thrilled to see one of North America's most endangered species receive the protection it needs.""
""Now that the Fish and Wildlife Service has listed the rusty-patched bumblebee as endangered, it stands a chance of surviving the many threats it faces,"" said Sarina Jepsen, the group's director of endangered species.

Scientists say disease, pesticide exposure, habitat loss and climate change are among possible reasons for the decline of the bee, named for the rusty reddish patch on the backs of workers and males. Most of the grasslands and tallgrass prairies where they once thrived have been converted to farms or urban areas.
Advocates said they hoped the recovery plan would also help other struggling pollinators, including bees and the monarch butterfly.

The bee's endangered listing, approved by the service shortly before President Barack Obama left office, had been scheduled to take effect Feb. 10. But the Trump administration, which has pledged to pare back federal regulations, said it would postpone the listing until Tuesday. Some environmental groups had feared it would be cancelled altogether.
The Natural Resources Defence Council filed a lawsuit over the delay, saying it had been ordered without required public notice and comment. On Tuesday, the group said the administration had ""reversed course and listed the rusty-patched bumblebee as an endangered species just in the nick of time.""
""Federal protections may be the only thing standing between the bumblebee and extinction,"" said Rebecca Riley, senior attorney with the group.
Six business organizations petitioned the government earlier this month to push back the effective date to Jan. 11, 2018. The groups, including the American Petroleum Institute and the National Association of Home Builders, said the Obama administration had acted hastily without adequately considering how the designation would affect human activities.

""Once the listing decision takes effect, virtually every industry operating within the species' range — from agriculture and crop production to residential and commercial development, from energy production and distribution to manufacturing —will be profoundly affected,"" the petition said.
Too little is known about the bee's underground nesting and hibernation sites for developers to determine whether their work would do harm, the industry groups said. That may force businesses to choose between ""abandoning billions of dollars in economic activities"" or ""blindly risking"" a violation of the Endangered Species Act by going ahead with their projects, the groups said.
The Fish and Wildlife Service posted information on its website about how to determine whether an area being considered for development is likely to host rusty patched bumblebees and ways to meet legal requirements for protecting them.
The law prohibits killing, harassing or otherwise harming listed animals, although people can obtain permits that excuse limited ""takings"" of endangered species as a result of doing things that otherwise are legal.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/rusty-patched-bumblebee-first-of-species-declared-endangered-in-continental-u-s-1.4035688?cmp=rss

It's the first time in seven years that there has been an authorization bill for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, also known as NASA, said Sen. Ted Cruz, a chief sponsor of the bill.
Cruz joined several astronauts and other lawmakers in the Oval Office to watch Trump sign the bill.

Last week, Trump sent Congress a budget proposal that would authorize more than $19 billion in agency spending next year. Congress appropriates funding for all government departments and agencies.

""For almost six decades, NASA's work has inspired millions and millions of Americans to imagine distant worlds and a better future right here on earth,"" Trump said. ""I'm delighted to sign this bill. It's been a long time since a bill like this has been signed, reaffirming our commitment to the core mission of NASA: human space exploration, space science and technology.""
The measure amends current law to add human exploration of the red planet as a goal for the agency.
It supports use of the International Space Station through at least 2024, along with private sector companies partnering with NASA to deliver cargo and experiments, among other steps.
Trump invited several lawmakers to comment after the signing, starting with Cruz before moving on to Sen. Marco Rubio.

When Trump invited Vice-President Mike Pence to speak, Pence suggested that former astronaut and Sen. Bill Nelson be allowed to say a few words.
""He's a Democrat. I wasn't going to let him speak,"" Trump quipped, to laughter. Nelson did say a few words, praising the bill for putting the agency on a ""dual track"" with commercial companies making roundtrips to the International Space Station and NASA continuing to explore the universe.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/trump-nasa-mars-budget-1.4034733?cmp=rss

""This is Canada's moment. I think it's a time we should be bold,"" said Alan Bernstein, president of CIFAR, a global research network that funds hundreds of scientists in 16 countries.
Bernstein believes there are many reasons why Canada has become increasingly attractive to scientists around the world, including the political climate in the United States and the Trump administration's travel bans.
""It used to be if you were a bright young person anywhere in the world, you would want to go to Harvard or Berkeley or Stanford, or what have you. Now I think you should give pause to that,"" he said. ""We have pretty good universities here. We speak English. We're a welcoming society for immigrants.""​
The latest executive order signed by Trump bans people from six Muslim-majority countries from getting visas to come to the U.S. for 90 days. (The order has been temporarily halted after a judge in Hawaii ruled the ban appears to unconstitutionally target Muslims.)​

Bernstein said he has already spoken with three experienced scientists who want to transfer to Canadian universities, and two have received offers.​
Rush Holt, head of the American Association for the Advancement of Science — the world's largest science membership organization — isn't surprised about this.
The association sent a letter to the White House, signed by all 182 member agencies, after Trump's first executive order targeting travel was signed in January, arguing it would affect scientists hoping to come to the U.S. Holt said the concerns didn't change with the second travel ban.
""We do know scientists around the world are considering boycotting meetings here. And they're demanding the international science society hold their meetings in other countries other than the United States. I don't like to see that,"" said Holt, who's also a former Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives.
Adding to the anxiety, Holt said, is the budget blueprint from the White House last week, which would cut funding for many science-based programs, from the environment to health.
U.S. budget director Mick Mulvaney said there are cuts to climate change research because the president believes it is a ""waste of your money."" Mulvaney also said there were ""tremendous opportunities for savings"" through cuts to the National Institutes for Health.

Holt said younger scientists have organized a March for Science in April to send the message they disagree with the overall direction from the Trump administration.
""With this administration you don't even hear rhetoric that they have any understanding of what science could bring them. What science could bring their supporters even,"" Holt said.
Bernstein cautions that Canada should not be seen to be poaching scientists from the United States — but there is an opportunity.
""It's as if we've been in a choir of an opera in the back of the stage and all of a sudden the stars all left the stage. And the audience is expecting us to sing an aria. So we should sing,"" Bernstein said.
Bernstein said the federal government, with this week's so-called innovation budget, can help Canada hit the right notes.
""Innovation is built on fundamental science, so I'm looking to see if the government is willing to support, in a big way, fundamental science in the country.""

Federal Science Minister Kristy Duncan has been involved in a science review during the past year that examined all federal research to make sure it is flexible enough to respond to emerging opportunities.
She also pointed to the increases in funding in last year's budget to Canada's three largest granting councils: the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.
""We are committed to research, science, evidence-based policy. I'm proud of the investments our government made in the last budget. We had $2 billion for research and innovation infrastructure across the country. We made the largest investments in the three federal granting councils in a decade,"" Duncan told CBC Tuesday.
But Bernstein said that even with last year's influx of cash, the budgets for the granting councils still haven't kept pace with inflation in recent years.
""Those three big councils, they're the big ones who fund most university research, have not had a significant increase in their budgets for at least eight years. So the scientific community, the research community in Canada is hurting,"" Bernstein said.

Duncan said she is aware of the increase in the number of foreign students wanting to come to Canada.
""We've seen an increase in the applications from international students, and I'm proud of the climate we're creating here, and we want to attract young people and to encourage young people to consider careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics and particularly young women,"" Duncan told CBC.
Bernstein just hopes the government acts on this opportunity.
""We didn't seek this particular position in the world, but the stars are aligned. And I think we'd be making a huge mistake to let it go by without jumping on it and taking advantage of it. So this is our time to be bold and to take advantage of what's happening in the world.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/brain-gain-trump-canada-1.4034304?cmp=rss

Officials from the National Tiger Conservation Authority on Tuesday questioned officials from the Corbett wildlife park, a local zoo and villagers in the Himalayan foothills to determine what caused the tiger's death.

Officials in Uttarakhand state said the tiger had killed two people near Bailpadav village last week.



Forest rangers tracked the tiger and tranquilized it. The tiger appeared to have been crushed when the rescuers used an earthmover to try to scoop up the big cat to return it to the Corbett reserve forests.
A video of the operation has been widely shared on social media, prompting officials to begin the investigation.
India is home to about two-thirds of the world's wild tigers, with about 2,500. Shrinking tiger habitats due to rapid urbanization and the destruction of forests are increasingly bringing humans and wild animals into conflict.
More than 120 tigers died in India last year, while 31 people were killed in incidents involving attacks by tigers, Environment Minister Anil Dave told Parliament on Monday.
Of the 120, 31 tigers were killed by poachers while 48 deaths were due to old age and natural causes.

The reason for the ban was not immediately clear. U.S. security officials would not comment. The ban was revealed Monday in statements from Royal Jordanian Airlines and the official news agency of Saudi Arabia.
A U.S. official told The Associated Press the ban will apply to nonstop flights to the U.S. from 10 international airports serving the cities of Cairo in Egypt; Amman in Jordan; Kuwait City in Kuwait; Casablanca in Morocco; Doha in Qatar; Riyadh and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia; Istanbul in Turkey; and Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. The ban was indefinite, said the official.
A second U.S. official said the ban will affect nine airlines in total, and the Transportation Security Administration were to inform the affected airlines early Tuesday.




The officials were not authorized to disclose the details of the ban ahead of a public announcement and they spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Egyptian officials at the Cairo International Airport say they have not received any instructions on banning passengers from bringing laptops, iPads, cameras and some other electronics on board direct flights to the United States.
The officials say that a New York-bound EgyptAir flight departed on Tuesday and that passengers were allowed to take their laptops and other electronics on board in their carry-on luggage. Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri was among the passengers on board the New York flight.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to the media.
And the United Arab Emirates' national carrier says it has not changed its policies regarding electronics in aircraft cabins, suggesting it has not received new directives from American authorities.
Etihad Airways said in a statement on Tuesday that it will continue to work closely with American officials in the U.S. and at its base in Abu Dhabi, the Emirati capital, but for now its ""policies have not changed.""
It says it will update passengers if travel guidelines are revised.
U.S. border officials stationed in Abu Dhabi carry out passport and customs screenings before passengers board U.S.-bound flights under an existing pre-screening program.
Royal Jordanian said cellphones and medical devices were excluded from the ban. Everything else, the airline said, would need to be packed in checked luggage. Royal Jordanian said the electronics ban affects its flights to New York, Chicago, Detroit and Montreal.
David Lapan, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, declined to comment. The Transportation Security Administration, part of Homeland Security, also declined to comment.

A U.S. government official said such a ban has been considered for several weeks. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose the internal security discussions by the federal government.
Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly phoned lawmakers over the weekend to brief them on aviation security issues that have prompted the impending electronics ban, according to a congressional aide briefed on the discussion. The aide was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue and also declined to be publicly identified.
The ban would begin just before Wednesday's meeting of the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS in Washington. A number of top Arab officials were expected to attend the State Department gathering. It was unclear whether their travel plans were related to any increased worry about security threats.
Brian Jenkins, an aviation-security expert at the Rand Corp., said the nature of the security measure suggested that it was driven by intelligence of a possible attack. He added that there could be concern about inadequate passenger screening or even conspiracies involving insiders — airport or airline employees — in some countries.
Another aviation-security expert, professor Jeffrey Price of Metropolitan State University of Denver, said there were disadvantages to having everyone put their electronics in checked baggage. Thefts from baggage would skyrocket, as when Britain tried a similar ban in 2006, he said, and some laptops have batteries that can catch fire — an event easier to detect in the cabin than in the cargo hold.
Most major airports in the United States have a computer tomography or CT scanner for checked baggage, which creates a detailed picture of a bag's contents. They can warn an operator of potentially dangerous material, and may provide better security than the X-ray machines used to screen passengers and their carry-on bags. All checked baggage must be screened for explosives.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/electronics-banned-us-flights-middle-east-1.4033591?cmp=rss

It all started by accident 25 years ago to this day.
On March 20, 1992, Sherrington was out with a friend in the Mount Lorette area of Kananaskis Country when they spotted a golden eagle around 11 a.m., which they found interesting because they believed it to be relatively rare.
They then saw two more while they were having lunch. Then another.
And another.

By the end of the day, they counted more than 100 golden eagles, all heading northwest.
""I thought, this is not random,"" Sherrington told the  on the 25th anniversary of that day.
""This is something that is worth studying.""
He went back out a couple days later with a larger group and together they counted 250 eagles in a single afternoon.

They had discovered a golden eagle migration route — more like an expressway, as it turns out — that persists to this day.
""The following fall, I went out and had over 2,000 golden eagles coming the other way,"" Sherrington said.
""And that in itself was interesting because in most parts of the world, raptors use one route in the spring and a different route in the fall. But this was one-stop shopping.""
The next spring he counted 4,200 golden eagles, including 850 in a single day.

The discovery led to the creation of the  and its regular raptor count has become one of the largest and longest-running citizen science projects in the world.
Sherrington is back out tallying eagles this spring along with anyone who cares to join.
""Just come along,"" he said. ""Dress warmly. Bring some binoculars. You don't even need to do that; we have spare binoculars and telescopes.""
The eagles follow a route along the front ranges of the Rockies from Waterton National Park to northeastern British Columbia. Some have been known to fly that span in a southerly direction in less than two days.
""The speed that these birds can glide is quite phenomenal,"" Sherrington said.
""They're not exactly flocks, but they're all going on the same routes.""

The birds are actually quite ""antagonistic"" to one another but often end up bunching up in a situation Sherrington likens to heavy traffic hitting red lights along Calgary's Macleod Trail in rush hour.
""The traffic lights, in this case, are generally weather systems,"" he said.
""So they get held up for a couple of days by snow and low cloud and then it clears — which is the green light — and there's a sudden flood coming through. We've had up to 200 golden eagles in an hour coming through under those conditions.""
He believes the route to be an ancient one that eagles have followed for 11,000 years.
The group's 2017 spring migration count is underway now and continues until April 22.
Observers will be at the Mount Lorette site daily and you can find more information about how to join them .",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/eagle-count-peter-sherrington-25-year-anniversary-1.4032721?cmp=rss

The archeologists were getting ready to close up the site, but one of their final scans of the thick rock revealed something interesting: an outline of a human skull.
What they discovered was the oldest skull ever found in Portugal, dating back 400,000 years, and the westernmost fossil of a human skull ever found in Europe.

The discovery was made in 2014, but it took 2½ years to remove the cranium from the sediment. The slow and arduous work paid off, leaving the cranium in ""remarkably good condition,"" according to Rolf Quam, co-author of the  published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
Also discovered at the site was a set of Acheulean stone tools, teardrop-shaped hand-axe tools believed to have originated in the Middle East. The tools first appeared in Europe about 500,000 years ago.

The discovery was something of a surprise and illustrates how swiftly the invention of tools spread among early humans.
""This site being at the extreme western end of Europe … suggests the spread of this tool technology was relatively rapid,"" Quam said. 

The researchers were unable to determine whether the cranium belonged to a male or female, though they determined it belonged to an adult. 
And while the cranium revealed some clues, what's not yet clear is where this early ancestor of ours belongs in the evolutionary tree.
""There are some features that are telling us that these guys are ancestors of the Neanderthals — they're not fully Neanderthal yet, but they're on the way,"" Quam said.
One difference is the brain size, which is smaller for the newly discovered specimen than a Neanderthal's. 
However, some findings suggest that although the skull is not purely Neanderthal, it's pretty close. In Neanderthals, the mastoid process — a projection of bone behind the ear opening — doesn't project much, nor does it in this cranium. Earlier fossilized craniums show a protruding mastoid process. 
As well, the shape of the brow ridge resembles that of the Neanderthals, though there is an anatomical difference. 
""What species name is it?"" Quam asks. ""It is broadly similar to other ones from the Middle Pleistocene in Europe, but shows a unique combination of features, and these are all broadly ancestral to the later Neanderthals.""
Quam said that the specimen will be further studied with the hope it will yield more information about the human evolutionary puzzle.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/archeologists-400000-cranium-fossil-portugal-1.4026264?cmp=rss

A Dartmouth man is furious that after 25 years the Nova Scotia Registry of Motor Vehicles has cancelled his personalized licence plate with his last name Grabher on it, following a single complaint.
Lorne Grabher is of German heritage. He said he bought the plate as a gift for his father's 65th birthday. His father passed away in the 1990s and the plate has remained in the family.
Last December, he received a letter telling him the plate would be cancelled in January because the public cannot be expected to know it is his last name and ""can misinterpret it as a socially unacceptable slogan.""
""I was taken aback. How can you say my name is a slogan when it is not?"" Grabher told CBC News. 
""Where does the province of Nova Scotia and the government of Nova Scotia get the right to discriminate against a person's name?""

Grabher said his father taught his children to always be proud of their name and where they come from. 
He was even more offended by an email sent to CBC News by a spokesman from the Department of Transportation, Brian Taylor. It said: ""A complaint was received outlining how some individuals interpret [the name] as misogynistic and promoting violence against women.""
The email went on to say, ""With no way to denote that it is a family name on the plate, the department determined it was in the public's best interest to remove it from circulation.""
CBC requested an interview with Janice Hartland, the director of road safety at the Registry of Motor Vehicles, but was told there would not be one.
""I've never once had anybody come up to me and say they were offended,"" Grabher said. ""They would look at it and say, 'Am I reading this right?' And I would go, 'Yes.' And they would go, 'Is this your last name?' And I would go, 'Yes.' And they would always just give a little chuckle.""'

Grabher is familiar with the infamous recording of U.S. President Donald Trump using offensive language to say he wanted to ""grab her"" in reference to a woman. But Grabher said he is not Trump and that is not the intention of his plate.

""Donald Trump is a totally different person. He's ignorant. He doesn't care about anybody and I shouldn't be put in a class like him,"" Grabher said.

There are approximately 3,100 words that the provincial government has deemed unacceptable on licence plates. 
Words are banned for religious reasons, for being sexual, or for being in poor taste. In some cases a specific reason was never inputted into the system.

Some of the words that can't be on licence plates include: 

""I guess now I'm going to have to take my name out of the phone book because a person's been offended by it,"" Grabher said.
""I guess my wife has to change the name of her consulting company, Grabher's Consulting. That has to be taken away? I guess I'm going to have to change my birth certificate.""

Grabher said this is very personal, not only for himself, but his children and grandchildren. He's hoping someone will help him fight the government.
In the meantime, he has a Grabher licence plate his son sent him from Alberta. He's put it on the front of his car.

""I'm proud of it and as far as I know in Nova Scotia we're allowed to put whatever we want on the front of the car.""  
Taylor, the transportation spokesman, said the list of banned words ""is always evolving, as slang and language also continue to change and evolve.""
He said the department does not take decisions like this lightly and understands Grabher's frustration.
The department has offered to print alternative wording or to reimburse Grabher for the cost of the remaining life of the plate.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/license-plate-government-regulations-removal-last-name-1.4037912?cmp=rss

Whitehorse's Ivy Rudell and her husband were in their living room last week, when they spotted through their window something moving atop Golden Horn mountain.

""We took the binoculars and had a look and there was this  up there,"" said Rudell. ""It wasn't very clear.""


On Monday, Rudell decided to have another look.
""The light was perfect and I took the binoculars… and you could actually see the maple leaf.""
Rudell said it ""aroused a whole lot of curiosity.""
How did this flag get on top of the estimated 1,700-metre-high Golden Horn? When? And why? Was it for Canada 150, Rudell wondered?
That's when CBC reporter Philippe Morin took to Twitter with Rudell's mysterious sighting.
















When Shanks' photo was posted on the  page, Yukoners began to show interest — and pretty soon, they had some answers.




Turns out, it was a premeditated birthday mission that was years in the making.
""Ever since the first time I climbed Golden Horn, I knew I wanted to put a flag up there,"" said Donovan Cote. ""I thought it would be a really patriotic thing to do.""
After finally getting his hands on a large 14 by seven-foot Canadian flag, Cote and his buddies made a blueprint of the two-by-four structure to hold down the flag on the windy mountaintop.
""We did our homework.""

With a drill in hand, his team ""of crazy Canucks"" hauled the wood and flag up the mountain on snowmobiles. The day was warm and sunny, said Cote, but it came with its challenges.
""Right before I got to the mountain, my engine blew on my Ski-Doo,"" said Cote. ""But we ended up soldiering on.""

Mystery solved: ""It was an epic last ditch effort to have an awesome sledding weekend with my buddies.""
Cote says he is slightly disappointed that the flag is a mere black dot from the city, easily mistaken for a tree.
So it'll just be the ""maple syrup on top"" for those who make it to the peak, said Cote, who turned 32 years old last month.
""P.S. — happy birthday, Canada.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/whitehorse-mountain-flag-mystery-1.4034387?cmp=rss

""They're pretty much rotting from the inside and losing some limbs,"" said Michel Cote, executive director of ARCf de Saint-Jean, a voice for the local francophone community and now responsible for the statues. ""They're over 20 years old.""
The sculptures along Harbour Passage were commissioned in the 1990s by the now-defunct cultural group Festival de la Baie Française, according to Bernard Cormier, Saint John's cultural affairs officer.
Depicting Charles de La Tour, his heroic first wife, Françoise-Marie Jacquelin, and his rival Charles D'Aulnay, the statues are the work of New Brunswick chainsaw artist Albert Deveau.

Part of the problem with the statues is the way they were originally installed, Cormier said.
""They were placed into the ground like a totem pole, with the wood going into the ground maybe four or five feet or more,"" he said. ""Moisture has entered the wood from the bottom and spread upward.
""I don't think a lot of care went into the care, maintenance and placement of them.""
The statues received a ""facelift"" several years ago, Cote said, ""but the weather on the waterfront was a bit too much for them to handle.""
The three figures stand on concrete bases, which will also have to be removed.


Charles La Tour was named lieutenant-general and governor of Acadia in 1631 and established the first European settlement in what is now Saint John with his wife, Françoise-Marie Jacquelin,
In 1645 Jacquelin, by that time Lady La Tour, famously assumed command of the garrison and led a battle to defend the fort against a rival governor, Charles D'Aulnay, during the Acadian Civil War.

The Lioness of La Tour, as Françoise-Marie Jacquelin came to be called, is memorialised elsewhere in Saint John, on a mural installed in December on the Harbour Passage and in another Albert Deveau statue in Wolastoq Park.
""The statue was a little piece that showed that [these people] were here,"" Cote said. ""We would like to have something bigger that will tell exactly what happened.""

Although the statues will be removed ""as soon as possible,"" according to Cote, other plans for the site are in development.
Two new murals by Saint Andrews artist Geoff Slater and Susan Sacobie and Gina Brooks from St. Mary's First Nation that were installed in December tell the story of the area's aboriginal history and that of Françoise-Marie Jacquelin.
An effort has been underway since the 1970s to develop Fort La Tour — already a designated provincial tourist site — as a tourism attraction, with recreated buildings, walking trails and an interpretative centre.

""We're really hoping that the murals and the buzz will allow us to tell this beautiful story,"" said Beth Hatt, chair of the Fort La Tour Development Authority board of directors. ""We're hoping to have shovels in the ground for Canada 150, but we need money from all levels of government.
""It is such a gem in the middle of the city and we really want to see some parts of the fort rebuilt.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fort-latour-statues-removed-1.4034208?cmp=rss

Joan Dohey, now a life coach, has a new initiative called ""adult kindergarten"" for those who may have forgotten everything they learned way back then.

Dohey, who used to teach little kids during their first year in school, wants to bring back fun for grown-ups.
""The whole idea with kindergarten for adults is that we all get way too serious, and we're in what's called task-positive mode most of the time,"" she told CBC Radio's 
""You can't be as creative if you're constantly in task-positive mode. But when you play, or you just sit and daydream, you're in default mode. And it's in default mode that you tap into your creativity.""

Adult kindergarten is supposed to help people re-establish play and laughter in their lives. There are different centres set up, including one for Lego, one for art and one for discovery.
They also dance and use a paper shredder to help release stress.
""The first thing that we usually do is we go into the kitchen and there's some pieces of paper where you write down anything that's bothering you. So if you've had a bad day, if somebody ticked you off, you write it down on the piece of paper and right next to it is the shredder — you shred it,"" Dohey said.
""Basically it's a way to let go of things that bother you, that worry you. There's a great feeling of freedom [that] comes with that.""
The program appeals to a person's inner child, but there's a deeper purpose behind the fun. Dohey said incorporating aspects of play and laughter into your life can be good for your health, by lowering blood pressure.
""There's a lot of healing that happens when people play and when they laugh,"" she said.
""There are many, many people who've gone through a tough time in childhood or who didn't have the opportunity to play or who had to grow up quickly because of some problem that they had. And if you can get back in touch with that child again, you're going to be balanced.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/adult-kindergarten-1.4029176?cmp=rss

A devastating storm covered southern Quebec on Tuesday and Wednesday, leaving residents struggling to get around later in the week.

Sidewalks were treacherous and many cars were encased by about 40 centimetres of snow.
But the owners of children's entertainment company  saw it as an opportunity to brighten people's day.
They decided to send Batman to the rescue.
""We went into all the side streets to find people who were trying to get rid of snow and when we found a person who was working we helped them right away,"" MJ Anim'Action co-founder Mehdi Bennani Smires told CBC News.





The duo stayed close to their headquarters in Montreal's Rosemont borough, delivering about five hours of good deeds to their neighbours.
By Saturday, a video compilation of their exploits, which they posted on YouTube, had almost 50,000 views.

Bennani Smires said almost everyone was very happy to see the Caped Crusader joining the snow removal efforts — except the first person he offered to help.

""They didn't want help, but we decided we wouldn't give up,"" Bennani Smires said.
Bennani Smires and MJ Anim'Action's other co-founder, Julien Bauby, also went to senior's residences in costume to help elderly people cross slippery streets.
Those searching for a comic book reference to explain why it was Batman roaming the streets with a shovel, instead of another superhero, won't find one. The Batman costume simply had the most insulation.
""I couldn't be Spiderman. It was too cold,"" Bennani Smires said.


Shovelling as Batman has all the makings of a publicity stunt, but Bennani Smires says it's the kind of volunteer work that's integral to what his company does.
""We have nice costumes and we know how to talk to kids because we used to be children's educators. We know children's needs,"" Bennani Smires said.

​They now volunteer at Sainte-Justine Hospital, meeting kids in costume, as part of the Starlight Foundation and Rêves d'enfants — two charities that work to lift the spirits of seriously ill children.
""We're people who dress up as superheroes but the real superheroes are the kids, the ones fighting illness,"" Bennani Smires said. 



The co-founders each have kids of their own and both came to Quebec from France in the past ten years.
Bennani Smires said Thursday's creative volunteering was a way thank their new home.

The biography,, was expected to be available for sale at an upcoming tribute concert by Symphony Nova Scotia.
But the book's publisher, Formac Publishing, issued a news release Thursday saying the symphony had ""banned"" the book and its author, Charlie Rhindress, from giving a talk ahead of Saturday's concert in Halifax.

MacNeil's son, Wade Langham, said he hasn't read Rhindress's book but simply preferred to have MacNeil's own autobiography, , sold at the concert. The book was published in 1998 and later reprinted.

Symphony Nova Scotia reiterated Langham's wishes in an emailed statement, saying it has ""agreed to focus on Rita's own autobiography, as well as merchandise from the concert's guest artists"" at the family's request.
Publisher James Lorimer told CBC that cancelling Rhindress's appearance and book sales ""in my mind, equals a ban.""
Rhindress said he thinks there is room for two books about MacNeil, who died in 2013 at the age of 68.
""There is a big difference between an autobiography and a biography,"" said Rhindress, a Nova Scotia writer, actor and director.
""I talked a lot about what a trailblazer Rita was and how important she was to the women's movement but also how important she was to East Coast music. She was the first artist to really stay on the East Coast and have an international career.""

Born in Big Pond, N.S., MacNeil recorded 24 albums during her career, collecting multiple Junos, East Coast Music Awards and Country Music Awards along the way. Her CBC variety show,, earned MacNeil a Gemini. ​

She was named to both the Order of Nova Scotia and the Order of Canada. 
Rhindress said MacNeil herself might have been too modest to take credit for many of the achievements he describes in his book.
In 2008, Rhindress wrote a play about MacNeil called .
He said they worked closely together and she came to trust him.
""I never would want to violate that trust ... I think it's a very respectful biography,"" Rhindress said.

As for his publisher's media advisory, Rhindress said, ""I think ban is a very strong word.""
Rhindress said he was disappointed fans attending the concert wouldn't have the opportunity to learn more about MacNeil by hearing his talk.

In their place will be a Tyrannosaurus rex, a penguin and a rubber ducky.
More than 4.3 million voters from 146 countries weighed in on which tokens they wanted to see in future versions of the property-acquisition game, which is based on the real-life streets of Atlantic City. Pawtucket, R.I.-based Hasbro announced the winners Friday morning.
Jonathan Berkowitz, Hasbro's senior vice president of marketing, grew up playing the game with his family.

""While I'm sad to see the iconic thimble, boot, and wheelbarrow tokens go, it will be fun to have some new, fan-sourced tokens in the mix,"" he said.
""Personally, I've always especially liked the boot token, but I'm excited to move onto the T. rex.""
There were 64 contenders, including a winking emoji, a hashtag, a clunky `80s-style cellphone and a pair of bunny slippers.
The existing Scottish Terrier, battleship, racecar, top hat and cat tokens will carry on.

The Scottie was top dog in the competition, leading all contenders with 212,476 votes. The T. rex was second with 207,954, and the hat was third with 167,582.
The car was fourth with 165,083; the ducky was fifth with 160,485; the cat was sixth with 154,165; the penguin waddled into seventh place with 146,661; and the battleship made the final cut with 134,704 votes.
The closest unsuccessful candidate was the tortoise, which fell nearly 5,700 votes short.
A rain boot got the least support, with 7,239 votes.
The next version of the game will go on sale with the new tokens in the fall.
The board game was ""born"" on March 19, 1935, when Parker Brothers acquired the rights to it. In the decades since, an estimated 1 billion people have weighed the merits of buying up utilities and railroads or trying to hit it big with Boardwalk hotels.
The original 10 tokens were an iron, purse, lantern, racecar, thimble, shoe, top hat, battleship, cannon and a rocking horse.",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/monopoloy-new-pieces-1.4029373?cmp=rss

MacPhail has only been with the restaurant for three years but said other staff have noticed notes being left behind in the walls since opening in 2001.
""You get stuff from all over the world, leaving notes about honeymoons, getting married, family vacations. It's a really great thing to see,"" she said.

While there's been no official count, MacPhail said there are around 150 notes placed in the walls of the restaurant.
""Just special moments in their lives that they got to document and leave here for us. It's a good treat,"" said MacPhail.


""We just touch them to read them and then we put them back,"" she said. ""It's a nice guest experience for people to come in, sit down and get a little bit of history of someone else's stay here.""

Stephanie Wade, a server at the restaurant, said customers will notice the notes, and will be inspired to write their own.
""I had this couple the other day … they were taking a knife and fork, trying to get this one note out all night,"" said Wade.

A  published in the journal Animal Cognition has found that our canine companions are able to deceive us in order to get something they desire. And they can figure out how to do it quite quickly.
Researcher and lead author of the paper Marianne Heberlein was curious about her own dogs' behaviour. Like many dog owners, Heberlein had a nighttime routine: let the dogs out to relieve themselves and then give them a treat when they came back inside.

However, one day she noticed that one of the dogs would just pretend to pee in order to get the treat. This spurred her curiosity as to what was really going on and if the dog was purposely attempting to deceive her.
In order to study the behaviour, Heberlein and her research team from the University of Zurich conducted an experiment. Using 27 dogs, the team paired each one with two human partners: a co-operative one who allowed the dogs to eat treats, and a competitive one who withheld the treats.
After the dogs learned which was which, the dogs then had the chance to lead them to one of three boxes: in one there was a sausage; in another was a less appetizing dog treat; and the last one was empty.

On the first day, the dogs led the co-operative partners to the sausage box more often than expected by chance and more often than the competitive partner. On the second day that increased in both cases.
By leading the competitive partner to the incorrect box, this meant that the dog had a chance to keep the delicious sausage for itself later on, when the experiment was repeated with a co-operative partner. Hence, the apparently deceptive behaviour.
This ability, the researchers say, was learned quite quickly compared to other studies involving primates, which can take upward of a hundred trials before the animals made this association and acted accordingly.

The findings did surprise Heberlein somewhat.
""They really have the capacity from the cognitive aspect to use such a strategy to have a benefit in their lives,"" Heberlein said. ""It's tactical deception, basically.""
Daphna Buchsbaum, assistant professor at the University of Toronto's department of psychology, said that this is a good step in studying the social reasoning abilities of dogs.
Humans tend to think of themselves as unique, and cognitive abilities is one of those things that some believe sets us apart — and above — other animals. But more and more, this belief is being challenged as other species are found to be making cognitive choices.
Still, the speed at which the dogs learned was notable.
""I do think it's impressive that they got the co-operative/competition task quite quickly,"" Buchsbaum said. ""It's promising that they're solving the problem and not just gradually learning more simple association.""

However, she believes there needs to be more study in order to definitively say that the dogs are being deceptive.
""You'd want to see them being similarly flexible in similar situations,"" she said. 
As well, since it's unclear if this cognitive ability developed out of the domestication of dogs, a study on other canines, such as wolves, would also lend itself to support the findings, something that Heberlein also acknowledged.
As for the age-old battle over which is smarter, cats or dogs, Buchsbaum laughed, saying, ""I think one of the biggest differences is that the dogs care and the cats don't. The argument is: are dogs smarter than cats because they understand our communication and they do what we tell them to, or are cats smarter because they don't do what we tell them to and we feed them anyway?""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/dogs-deception-1.4019103?cmp=rss

""I came in from the back and there was Elton John standing there with his two bodyguards, digging through records,"" said Beat Street Records manager Lindsay Tomchyshen.
The bodyguards weren't the type to get mistaken for tiny dancers.

From uncomfortable glances, to double-takes, to pulling over to the side of the road, Fleet has seen it all in her first car: a 1994 Cadillac hearse she's owned since October 2016.
""Sometimes you'll get a thumbs up,"" said the 25-year-old.
""Or sometimes a guy will take his hat off. People cross themselves. Sometimes people slow down almost to a stop because they think it's part of a procession. There's a lot of staring.""

Fleet found the hearse for sale on Kijiji by a private seller in Salisbury. It originally belonged to Rooney Funeral Home, established in Alberton, P.E.I., in 1955.
The seller was, appropriately, named Harold.
""I feel like she had to be named Maude,"" said Fleet, a fan of the 1971 film , in which the main character drives two hearses.
Having been used mainly for short, gentle drives, the car was in great shape.
She got it for $2,000.
""They don't sell for much, even in pristine condition,"" she said. ""Most people don't want to drive hearses.""


Fleet has laid a Persian rug in the back of the hearse, which contains a fold-out laminate table and rollers used by funeral home employees to slide the casket in.
""I wanted it to look a little more homey back there and a little less creepy,"" she said.
""It has these strange fake windows with ruched brocade fabric and chrome wreaths.""

""There's track lighting along the top of the fake windows where the wreaths are. Not sure of the purpose of that. Ambience for the person back there, I guess?""
Despite its interesting details, the hearse has needed a bit of work, and it ""did have a bit of a musty smell when I first got it,"" she said.
The length — at 6.7 metres, a little longer than an average pickup truck — and lower ground clearance have also taken getting used to.

But even in winter, ""it's quite reliable. Even in –20 C, it's always started the first time. But it's a very low car to the ground. Good thing it has rear-wheel drive.""
Reliable or not, ""I've had a few people tell me they would never get in my car,"" Fleet said. ""They'd rather walk home.""

Nor do all the neighbours appreciate Maude.
Fleet usually parks on Rothesay Road, since the driveway of her family's house — a converted church, formerly St. James the Less — gets icy, and the vehicle is tricky to back out.
""It's been a problem for some people,"" she said.
""My neighbour got a phone call. Some people have made complaints. I'm not really sure what their problem is with it, but I assume it's something to do with the mortality that a hearse makes you think of.""
John Jarvie, the town manager in Rothesay, said there have been calls about the vehicle.
""It's unusual to see a hearse, other than at a funeral home or at a funeral,"" he said. ""When one is parked on the road, it raises questions.""
The hearse even came up at at the Feb. 13 meeting of Rothesay council, Jarvie said.
""A comment was made that it was unusual.""
But while some of the neighbours might not like it, there's no law against driving the hearse or parking it on the side of the road, provided it's inspected, not blocking traffic and in compliance with other traffic laws.
""I'm not aware of any bylaws that would prohibit the parking of the hearse simply because people find it off-putting,"" Jarvie said. ""People have unusual tastes, or drive unusual vehicles, but there's no law against it.""

Fleet's far from the first to use a funeral coach as a daily driver.
Neil Young and his band used a hearse, nicknamed Mort, to cart gear around Winnipeg gigs. (Mort later inspired the song .) Sam the Sham, singer for '60s rock outfit the Pharaohs, also gigged in a 1952 Packard funeral coach.
Claire Fisher of the HBO funeral-home family drama  was depicted bombing around L.A. in a lime-green 1971 Cadillac model.
For Fleet, it's a practical choice, as well as a fashion statement.
""I'm an artist, and that's part of the reason I decided to get this car,"" said Fleet, who plans to hold onto it at least until she leaves to pursue a master of fine arts at Nova Scotia College of Art and Design.
""I wanted something large that can carry heavy loads of photography and video equipment. This seemed perfect.""
There are other benefits too.
""When I go grocery shopping with this car, I can always find it when I come out,"" she said.
""There's just empty space beside it — no one wants to park beside me.""

A lot of people ask questions. The most common one,  is why would such a self-described ""shy, reserved"" person pick up such an outlandish vehicle?
She shrugs.
""It's a nice Cadillac with a good smooth ride and a good stereo,"" she said.
""I love vintage stuff. I studied film history, and I feel like it suits me.""
The main downside? ""There are no speakers in the back,"" she deadpans.
""I just think it's a beautiful car. If anything, it adds a little mystique to the area.""",2017-03-23T19:25:34Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/death-becomes-her-1.4018928?cmp=rss
ff60e01b22ace4abb811d9a329338884c17b8ccc,Matt Kwong,2017-03-24T00:36:02Z,'The damage is done': Devin Nunes's Trump briefing prompts 'grave' concerns about credibility,"He can apologize all he wants, but Devin Nunes's ill-considered move this week to leapfrog his panel colleagues by informing the White House about surveillance of the Trump team has already fractured his committee, deepened doubts about its fairness and amplified calls for an independent probe.
Trust in Nunes, the chair of the U.S. House intelligence committee, has splintered after he shared with the Trump administration a report from the U.S. intelligence community that legal, broad surveillance activities might have ""incidentally collected"" communications with the president.
As the ranking Democrat on the committee, the expectation would have been that congressman Adam Schiff of California would be briefed first on the matter, along with Nunes's Republican committee colleagues. Instead, Schiff learned of the intelligence intercepts via a media statement.

Schiff slammed the chairman for acting as if he were a ""surrogate of the White House.""
""You don't take information that the committee hasn't seen and present it orally to the press and to the White House before the committee even has a chance to vet whether it's even significant,"" he fumed to reporters on Wednesday.
Cries from the Democratic side will likely grow louder for an independent investigation, says Mark Harkins, a congressional expert with the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. A censure motion or other disciplinary action for Nunes might be introduced on the House floor.

""Being that he's supposedly the chairman of the investigative committee but went directly to the executive branch, that leads to concerns as to whether he can properly execute the oversight role that Congress has over the executive branch.""

Speaking to CNN, Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, suggested that Nunes himself should become the subject of an investigation.
Senator John McCain, a fellow Republican, called the committee's integrity into doubt and told NBC News it was a ""bizarre situation.""
""What the American people have found so far is that no longer does Congress have the credibility to handle this alone,"" he said.

Nunes, a congressman from California, was a member of U.S. President Donald Trump's transition team. He apologized on Thursday for the unusual briefing, given his role as chair of the chief investigative panel probing Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 election.
It didn't appear to be enough. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Democratic congresswoman Jackie Speier, who sits on the House panel, said it was a ""grave question"" whether the committee should continue to have faith in their chairman.

""Over the next few days, we are going to assess whether or not we feel confident that he can continue in that role,"" she said.
Nunes's actions weren't just a breach of decorum, say veteran staffers of former House and Senate intelligence committees.
""It was a rupture in a relationship with the committee in a highly sensitive topic,"" says Mark Lowenthal, who served as a Republican staff director of the House permanent select committee on intelligence during the Bill Clinton administration.
Lowenthal believes Democrats will be wary of dealing with him further if they suspect Nunes, a staunch Trump ally on Capitol Hill, might have divided loyalties. He expects dysfunction can also bleed through into the House committee's affairs.

When a bipartisan committee comes apart in such a way, he said, ""it becomes very, very unpleasant; trust is lost and it's hard to get any work done.
""So yes, you can apologize, but the damage is done.""
Were he more politically astute, Lowenthal says, Nunes would have presented the intelligence report to Schiff regarding possible collection of surveillance of Trump, then shared his intentions to approach the president.

There may also be a collateral effect in the separate Senate intelligence committee into the Trump-Russia matter, which is to be chaired by Senator Richard Burr. The North Carolina Republican could be constricted by the fallout from his counterpart in the House committee.
That could be a positive outcome, says Gary Schmitt, a former staff director for the Senate select committee on intelligence.
""You'll see an effort by the [Senate intelligence] committee itself to be forced, in a way, to remain as bipartisan as possible, because its reputation is at stake,"" Schmitt says. ""Nunes has put them in a position where if they don't do their job in a very bipartisan way, the reputation of the institution suffers, and they suffer reputationally.""
Demands to form a new special committee such as the independent inquiry that looked into the Benghazi embassy attacks in 2012 are ""inevitable,"" Schmitt says.

The Trump administration, meanwhile, has seized upon the latest intelligence revelations by Nunes as validation of the president's debunked claims that the Obama administration ordered Trump Tower to be wiretapped.
When pressed further, though, Nunes stressed it was ""possible"" that routine U.S. surveillance of foreign targets — and unrelated to Trump — might have also scooped up some of the president's communications in the process. There remains no evidence that any wiretapping occurred, Nunes said.
Trump nevertheless wasted no time spinning the development in his favour. The morning after the Nunes uproar, Trump's campaign team issued a new email blast imploring subscribers to stand with the president against the scourge of so-called fake news. The email had a one-word subject line: ""Vindicated.""",2017-03-24T00:36:02Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/devin-nunes-trump-credibility-house-intelligence-committee-1.4038335?cmp=rss

The death toll from the attack rose to four on Thursday when police announced a 75-year-old man ""died tonight after his life-support was withdrawn.""
Masood was born in Kent to the southeast of London and had been most recently living in central England, London police said.
""Masood was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack,"" police said in a statement. ""However, he was known to police and has a range of previous convictions for assaults, including GBH [grievous bodily harm], possession of offensive weapons and public order offences.""

Several thousand people gathered Thursday evening in London's Trafalgar Square for a candlelit vigil to honour the victims and their families and to show London's unity in the face of militant attacks.
Dignitaries, police and clergy, including Buddhist monks in brown robes, gathered on the steps leading to the National Gallery. There was a strong sense of solidarity and camaraderie, with Muslims mingling with Jews and people stopping to thank the police for their work. After speeches and a minute's silence Amber Rudd, the home secretary MP, mayor Sadiq Khan and acting police commissioner Craig Mackey lit the three oversize candles to applause from the crowd
Earlier, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said the attacker had been investigated by British intelligence ""some years ago.""
May said he had been investigated by MI-5, the U.K.'s intelligence service, ""in relation to concerns of violent extremism,"" but that he was not part of what she called the current intelligence picture, saying he was a ""peripheral figure.""

Masood sped across Westminster Bridge in a car, ploughing into pedestrians along the way, then ran through the gates of the nearby Parliament building and fatally stabbed an unarmed policeman before being shot dead.
May and British police say they believe he acted alone and was ""inspired by international terrorism."" She said there is no reason to believe that ""imminent further attacks"" are planned.
She called Wednesday's events ""an attack on free people everywhere.""
ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, claimed responsibility for the attack, the group's Amaq news agency said on Thursday. The group has been responsible for numerous bloody attacks around the globe, but also has claimed certain attacks in a show of opportunism.




Forty people were injured and 29 remain in hospital, seven of whom are in critical condition. 


Those still in hospital included Britons and people from 10 other countries, including an American and three children from France.

A Mormon church official says a Utah man was one of the people killed and his wife was seriously wounded and remains in hospital. Kurt W. Cochran and his wife, Melissa, were on the last day of a trip celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary on Wednesday when the attacker struck.
The church said Thursday the Utah couple was also visiting the woman's parents who are Mormon missionaries in London.
And earlier, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said a British national whose mother is Spanish has been identified as one of the people killed.

A spokesman said that Spanish consular officials made contact with Aysha Frade's relatives in Spain's northwestern region of Galicia after her identity was confirmed. He was unable to give any further details.
The regional Voz de Galicia newspaper said that Frade was 43 years old and was teaching Spanish in London.
The identity of the 75-year-old who died Thursday was not immediately clear.

Queen Elizabeth sent her condolences on Thursday to those affected by the attack.
""My thoughts, prayers, and deepest sympathy are with all those who have been affected by yesterday's awful violence,"" she said in a statement. The Queen was due to officially open the new headquarters of London's police force on Thursday but will now do so at a later date.

Since the attack, police have raided at least six addresses, including in London and Birmingham, which have resulted in eight arrests in total.
Mark Rowley, assistant commissioner with the Metropolitan Police, said they were continuing to investigate the attacker's ""motivation, his preparation and his associates.""
May and Rowley said there will be an increased police presence in the city, including armed and unarmed officers, as well as more patrols.


The policeman killed was identified late Wednesday as Keith Palmer, 48.
Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, whose brother was killed in the Bali terror attack in 2002, performed first aid on the wounded police officer, who later died. About 10 yards away lay the assailant.
""I tried to stem the flow of blood and give mouth to mouth while waiting for the medics to arrive but I think he had lost too much blood,"" Ellwood said. ""He had multiple wounds, under the arm and in the back.""

May praised Palmer, calling him a hero who ""devoted his life to the service of his country."" She said the husband and father had been a member of the parliamentary and diplomatic protection command for 15 years. He had also been a soldier in the Royal Artillery. 

In Parliament Thursday, Conservative MP James Cleverly called for Palmer to receive posthumous recognition for his ""gallantry and sacrifice.""
Choking back tears, Cleverly said he first met Palmer 25 years ago as ""Gunner Keith Palmer"" when both men served in the Royal Artillery.
Cleverly said Palmer was ""a strong, professional public servant and it was a delight to meet him again only a few months after being elected.""

Jason Van Dyke pleaded not guilty through his attorney in a Chicago courtroom to 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm that were issued by a grand jury on March 16 and unsealed on Thursday by a special prosecutor, local media reported.
 of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald being shot 16 times by Van Dyke in October 2014 was released more than a year later, sparking protests and pushing the city into a national debate over police use of force, particularly in minority communities.
The release of the video also led to the ouster of the police chief. Van Dyke pleaded not guilty to murder in 2015 and is awaiting trial. Special prosecutor Joseph McMahon did not give an explanation for the new charges on Thursday. He denied in court that he sought the new charges to correct what the defense has called errors in the initial charges, the Chicago Tribune reported.
Four Chicago police officers were suspended for not having properly functioning dashboard cameras during the shooting, officials said in January. Chicago's Office of the Inspector General recommended 11 of the 15 officers involved in the incident be discharged. 
The U.S. Justice Department began a civil rights investigation in December 2015 after the video was released by court order.
 in January that Chicago police routinely violated the civil rights of people, citing excessive force, racially discriminatory conduct and a ""code of silence"" to thwart investigations into police misconduct.

""I hope we can find a compromise in the next two or three weeks,"" International Ice Hockey Federation President Rene Fasel told The Associated Press on Thursday in a telephone interview from Russia. ""We need to know by the end of April if they're coming, or not.""
Fasel said leaders of national teams, including those in Canada and Russia, have recently told him they need to know next month if it is time for them to assemble their Plan B rosters.
NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has made it clear league owners don't want to stop their season for three weeks again and put their stars at risk of injury without what they would consider a tangible return. The reluctance has come up in the past and yet the NHL has participated in every Winter Olympics since 1998.
This time, however, there seems to be an impasse.

""In the absence of any material change to the current status quo, NHL players will not be participating in the 2018 Winter Olympics,"" NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly wrote in an email to AP.
Don Fehr, the head of the NHL Players Association, said all players in the league want to participate and believes the NHL should choose to take advantage of the chance to market the game in Asia, which will host the next two Winter Olympics.
""Playing in an Olympic games is fundamentally different than playing in other tournaments, other hockey events, because it's an opportunity to play for your country on a global stage with fans watching who never otherwise watch hockey games,"" Fehr said. ""There's a patriotic element, too, which players feel and feel very strongly and it's something we should applaud and be proud of for them. And to take that opportunity away would be most, most unfortunate.""
The NHL has acknowledged it isn't excited about the prospects of marketing the sport in South Korea, but it is very interested in being part of the 2022 Olympics in China.
Fasel suggested that might not be an option.
""If they don't go to Korea, it will be very difficult for them to go to Beijing,"" Fasel said. ""The IOC will be in a different position and it would be a totally different deal on the table for the NHL. The NHL has more to lose than to win if they don't come to Pyeongchang. If they don't come, they will isolate themselves. The fans will not be happy and the players won't be happy and then I would say, `Good luck with negotiations to go to China.""'
Even if the NHL doesn't set up next season's schedule with an Olympic break, Washington Capitals and Russian superstar Alex Ovechkin has vowed to go to the 2018 Olympics and he may not be the only one to test the league's stance.

8d0a031e0d082294f7b36d135c842eb6b89199ef,Nahlah Ayed,2017-03-24T11:20:37Z,"The officer and the MP: both tried to save lives, only one succeeded","Before any of it happened, the officer and the politician lived oddly parallel lives.
They both worked at Westminster. They were just two years apart in age. And at times in life they both carried the titles of father, and soldier.
When their lives violently intersected on Wednesday afternoon, Keith Palmer and Tobias Ellwood shared one other title: hero.
On the day of the Westminster attack, both men had tried to save lives. Only one succeeded. And now he is dead.
While panic spread inside Parliament and MPs and staff scrambled to get to safety, London Police Const. Keith Palmer, who was unarmed, sustained multiple stab wounds trying to keep the attacker out of the building. 

Their confrontation ended with both attacker and policeman dead. Khalid Masood was shot by Palmer's colleagues. Palmer succumbed to his extensive injuries.
The tragedy of a premature end to a full life has since been coloured by the valour of his final act.
""He was every inch a hero,"" Prime Minister Theresa May told the Commons. ""And his actions will never be forgotten.""


Though his act was singular, Palmer was not alone that afternoon.
In the aftermath, Westminster Bridge was strewn with brave acts: complete strangers — ordinary people — stopped to comfort the injured. Nurses from a nearby hospital rushed over with blankets.

And an MP pushed in to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to Police Const. Palmer.
The image of Ellwood, his face blotched with blood, was Wednesday's preferred, front-page depiction of the shock of that day. Ellwood's desperate attempt to save Palmer — and the officer's final act — became a comforting strand to a story about wanton violence.
""Yesterday, we saw the worst of humanity, but we will remember the best,"" May told the Commons on Thursday. ""We will remember the extraordinary efforts to save the life of PC Keith Palmer, including those by my Right Honourable Friend, the member for Bournemouth East.""
Ellwood listened tearfully, nodding to the cheers of his fellow MPs.
He said nothing.

The junior foreign minister hasn't spoken publicly since the ordeal, though in comments published in the Daily Mail, apparently just after the attack, he described his efforts.

""I tried to stem the flow of blood and give mouth to mouth while waiting for the medics to arrive but I think he had lost too much blood,"" he is quoted as saying.
It must have been devastating for someone whose life had been touched by an extremist attack. Ellwood's own brother was killed in the Bali bombings of 2002.

Now in another tragic parallel, Palmer's family too is devastated.
""Keith will be remembered as a wonderful dad and husband,"" they said in a statement. ""A loving son, brother and uncle … A friend to everyone who knew him. He will be deeply missed.""
Palmer had been a police officer for over 15 years, and had just joined the security team in Parliament under a year ago. He was married with a five-year old daughter.

Another MP, James Cleverly, who served with Palmer in the reserves, had known him for 25 years.
""He was a strong professional public servant, and it was delight to meet him here again,"" he said tearfully in the house.
A woman called in to a radio show yesterday to say Palmer had saved her life after a car accident.
""I owe him everything,"" she told LBC radio.

At a permanent National Police memorial, and in several pockets near the attack site, colleagues and members of the public left flowers and messages praising Palmer.
""Forever in our thoughts, may you rest in peace – from your police colleagues at Royal Parks,"" said one message.

Colleagues have began a funding campaign, which quickly far exceeded its target. Palmer's death cut close for serving officers.
""I found it tragic, I won't lie to you. I shed a tear when I got up,"" Ken Marsh, chairman of the police federation and an active officer, told CBC News.

In a country now consumed with the identity of the killer, Palmer's story is an antidote, forever linked with Ellwood's and seared in Westminster's memory.
""It reminded us all of how we are all so connected,"" home secretary Amber Rudd told a crowd gathered for a vigil in Trafalgar Square last night, ""especially when the random victims on the bridge of different nationalities, tourists going about their business, also mowed down in a terrible way.
""But they will not win.""",2017-03-24T11:20:37Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/officer-mp-london-attack-heroism-1.4038923?cmp=rss
33f7e9d6c6b7b214f1601611604ca93267ae746e,The Associated Press,2017-03-24T11:20:37Z,"Win or lose, Trump wants health-care vote today","U.S. Republicans got their health-care overhaul past an initial barrier and toward a climactic roll call Friday, plunging ahead despite uncertainty over whether they had the votes to prevail in what loomed as a monumental gamble for President Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress.

With Trump budget chief Mick Mulvaney and other White House officials heading toward the Capitol to lobby wavering lawmakers, Friday's showdown was occurring after the president warned that he was through negotiating with holdouts. In a message delivered to rank-and-file Republicans at the Capitol late Thursday, top Trump aides said if the measure failed he would move on to the rest of his agenda.
""We'll see what happens,"" Trump said at the White House Friday when asked his course should the measure fail.
In a morning tweet, Trump targeted the House Freedom Caucus, whose hard-right members have been the core of opposition to the Republican legislation and have come under intense pressure from the White House and party leaders to fall into line.
The bill would replace major parts of President Barack Obama's health-care law and would block federal payments for a year to Planned Parenthood.



""The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood, allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan!"" Trump wrote.

In the day's first meaningful roll call, the House used a near party-line 230 to 194 vote to insert changes into the measure that leaders hoped would win over unhappy Republicans.
These included improving Medicaid benefits for some older and disabled people and abolishing coverage requirements that Obama's 2010 law imposes on insurers.
The bill would eliminate the Obama statute's unpopular fines on those who do not obtain coverage and the often generous subsidies for those who purchase insurance.

Instead, consumers would face a 30 per cent premium penalty if they let coverage lapse. Republican tax credits would be based on age, not income. The bill would also end Obama's Medicaid expansion and trim future federal financing for the federal-state program and let states impose work requirements on some of its 70 million beneficiaries.
Republican aides were privately saying conservative opposition was softening, yet another moderate announced he would oppose the legislation. Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, of New Jersey, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the bill ""would place significant new costs and barriers to care on my constituents.""
Friday's votes stood as the biggest to date for Trump and for House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican from Wisconsin, both aware that conservatives comprising the heart of their party's constituency were demanding no less than an all-out assault on Obama's law.
For Trump, victory would clear an initial but crucial hurdle toward achieving the party's quest to repeal ""Obamacare,"" the former president's 2010 health-care overhaul. Defeat could weaken Trump's political potency by adding a legislative failure to a resume already saddled with inquiries into his campaign's Russia connections and his unfounded wiretapping allegations against Obama.


In an embarrassing setback Thursday, leaders abruptly postponed the vote because a rebellion by conservatives and moderates would have doomed the measure. They'd hoped for a roll call Thursday, which marked the seventh anniversary of Obama's enactment of his landmark health-care statute that Republicans have vowed ever since to annul.
The leaders seem to be calculating that at crunch time enough dissidents will decide against sabotaging the bill, Trump's young presidency and the House Republican leadership's ability to set the agenda, with a single, crushing defeat.
Even if they prevail, Republicans face an uphill climb in the Senate, where conservatives and moderates are also threatening to sink the legislation.

In a bid to coax support from conservatives, House leaders proposed a fresh amendment — to be voted on Friday — repealing Obama's requirement that insurers cover 10 specified services like maternity and mental health care. Conservatives have demanded the removal of those and other conditions the law imposes on insurers, arguing they drive premiums skyward.
Many moderates are opposed because they say the bill would leave many voters uninsured. Medical associations, consumer groups and hospitals are opposed or voicing misgivings, and some Republican governors say the bill cuts Medicaid too deeply and would leave many low-income people uncovered.
Republicans can lose only 22 votes in the face of united Democratic opposition. A tally by The Associated Press found at least 32 ""no"" votes, but the figure was subject to fluctuation amid frantic Republican lobbying.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said changes Republican leaders had proposed before Thursday to win votes had cut the legislation's deficit reduction by more than half, to $150 billion US over the next decade. But it would still result in 24 million more uninsured people in a decade.
Obama's law increased coverage through subsidized private insurance for people who don't have access to workplace plans, and a state option to expand Medicaid for low-income residents. More than 20 million people have gained coverage since the law was passed in 2010.",2017-03-24T11:20:37Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/u-s-healthcare-bill-vote-1.4039248?cmp=rss

As the fast-moving investigation led to more arrests and searches, police revealed that the attacker, Khalid Masood, was born Adrian Russell Ajao in southern England in 1964. Police said he had also gone by the name Adrian Elms, and could be known by a number of other names, too.

In a briefing outside Scotland Yard, London's top counterterror officer, Mark Rowley, said two more ""significant"" arrests had been made, bringing to nine the number of people in custody over Wednesday's attack.
He appealed to the public for information about Masood.
Detectives have searched 21 properties in London, the central English city of Birmingham and Wales.

""We've seized 2,700 items from these searches, including massive amounts of computer data for us to work through,"" Rowley said, adding that contact had been made with 3,500 witnesses.
""We've received hundreds of uploads of video images to our online platform. Given this attack was in the heart of the capital, we also, of course, are dealing with statements from a wide range of nationalities.""
Masood drove his car into crowds of people on Westminster Bridge on Wednesday afternoon before fatally stabbing a police officer at the Houses of Parliament. He was shot dead by police.

An American man from Utah, a British man and British woman were killed on the bridge, and police officer Keith Palmer died at Parliament, police said.
The latest victim, who died in a hospital on Thursday, was identified as 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from south London.
More than 50 people of a dozen nationalities were injured, 31 of whom required hospital treatment.
""Those affected include a real cross-section of ages from at least 12 nationalities,"" Rowley said. ""It's a poignant reminder, I think, that the impact of this attack on the capital will reach around the world. ""
Rowley said two police officers targeted in the attack have significant injuries. Two other people also remain in critical condition, one with life-threatening injuries.


The 52-year-old attacker was born in southeastern England and had most recently been living in Birmingham, where several properties have been searched by police.
Police say Masood has used several aliases and had a string of convictions between 1983 and 2003 for offences, including assault and possession of an offensive weapon.
Prime Minister Theresa May said Thursday that Masood was ""investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism"" some years ago. But she called him ""a peripheral figure.""
On Thursday, ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, claimed responsibility for Masood's attack, although it was unclear what links — if any — he had with the militant group.
Police said there had been no prior intelligence about his intent to mount an attack. And they have offered little detail about him and what might have led to the attack.
""Our working assumption is that he was inspired by international terrorism,"" said Rowley.


Nine people remain in custody on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts.
Once his identity became known, police and the media began to trace the movements of the attacker in his final hours.

The car Masood used in the attack had been rented from rental firm Enterprise's Spring Hill branch in Birmingham.
The manager of a hotel in the beachside city of Brighton, where Masood stayed the night before the incident, said he seemed unusually outgoing and mentioned details about his family, including having a sick father.
""He was normal, in fact friendly, because we spent possibly five or 10 minutes talking to him about his background and where he came from,"" Sabeur Toumi told Sky News on Friday.
Police raided the room at the Preston Park Hotel in Brighton after the attack, searching for clues about Masood. Among the items seized were the trouser press and the toilet paper holder.

A former neighbour from Birmingham said: ""When I saw the pictures on TV and in the papers of the man who carried out the attack, I recognized him as the man who used to live next door.""
""He had a young child, who I'd think was about five or six years old. There was a woman living there with him, an Asian woman. He seemed to be quite nice, he would be taking care of his garden and the weeds,"" Iwona Romek, 45, told reporters at her home.
In December, she said, he suddenly moved out.",2017-03-24T11:20:37Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/london-parliament-attacker-1.4039141?cmp=rss

Lately, the question has elicited some fiery exchanges between the scientists at the forefront of the argument.
Both sides claim to have great respect for the other's work, but when you speak with them, they're quick to mock their opponents' views on the subject.
Take Mike Brown of the California Institute of Technology. He discovered Eris, the celestial body located beyond Pluto that stirred up the debate about what constitutes a planet and ultimately led to the International Astronomical Union's vote in 2006 that demoted Pluto from planet to dwarf planet.
He calls some pro-planet Pluto arguments ""insane.""

Then there's Alan Stern, principal investigator of New Horizons, the spacecraft that flew by Pluto in 2015. He believes astronomers had no business voting on what constitutes a planet in the first place: ""We're called planetary scientists because we study planets. It's part of the title of our profession. We know what we're doing.""
Piero Benvenuti, general secretary of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), places the blame for the decade-old debate squarely on Stern and suggests few people actually support his cause. When asked why the debate has lasted so long, Benvenuti told CBC News: ""Because of Alan Stern. Because of the Horizons team … Why am I not getting French schoolboys or Italian schoolboys or Iranian schoolboys writing to me about Pluto?""


A paper Stern co-wrote provided a new attack in the Great Pluto Debate when it was presented earlier this week at the Lunar and Planetary Sciences Conference in Texas. It proposes a new definition for the word ""planet.""
According to the IAU's criteria, a planet has to orbit the sun; have sufficient mass and self-gravity to form a round object; and clear its neighbourhood in its orbit. But Stern's new simplified definition says a planet only has to form a sphere under its own gravity and hasn't undergone fusion, like a star.
Except, that would add more than 110 planets to our solar system. And it would include our moon.
Brown thinks the idea is ludicrous. ""Nobody wants the moon to be a planet,"" he said with a laugh.

Stern has criticized the IAU vote for several reasons: only 424 of its 10,000 members voted; they weren't representative of planetary scientists, who are the experts on planets; and, he says, ""you don't legislate science.""
But Brown says Stern's opposition is only about the result, not the process: ""He would have no complaint about the voting if the voting had gone in the direction he wanted.""

Along with Brown, Neil deGrasse Tyson, the renowned astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City, gets blamed in some circles for Pluto's fall from grace.
In 2000, Tyson removed Pluto from the planetarium's display of the solar system, instead placing it out in its own category (the debate began a year later as a result of a ). He received plenty of hate mail, but it didn't faze him. For anyone who has a problem with Pluto's dwarf planet status, Tyson usually has the same reply: Get over it.



But Stern will have none of that. 
""Neil has a PhD in astrophysics. Wrong profession,"" Stern said. ""Neil will find, this time, that he's tangling with something he can't stop. And he's going to end up on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of science, and he'll end up having to apologize, because the field is laughing at him.""
Kirby Runyon, a planetary geologist and lead author of the new paper with Stern, said Tyson's arguments for not including Pluto as a planet can be proven incorrect. For example, Tyson said Pluto needed to be reclassified because of its odd orbital inclination —  it's on an inclination of 17 degrees compared to the rest of the planets —  its extreme elliptical orbit and because it would vaporize if it were to pass too close to the sun. 

""If you take any planet and move it too close to a star, it's going to vaporize. If Jupiter were in an elongated, elliptical orbit, it would still be considered a planet,"" Runyon said.
Though Runyon praises Tyson for his work bringing science to the masses, he said his arguments aren't up to his normal scientific standards.
""It's so easily rebutted,"" Runyon said. ""Look, Neil is an astrophysicist … I'm a planetary geologist. I actually study planets.""

So what's the big deal if Pluto is a planet or a dwarf planet? 
""What we call things affects how we think about them, how we intuit about them, how we compare it to other things that are similar or different,"" Runyon said.
For example, if Pluto doesn't have the prestige of being a planet, Runyon and Stern argue, that could affect the public's view of whether it's worth funding a mission to explore it.
Brown says that argument makes no sense. 
""If they can't make the case that the object that they sent their billion-dollar spacecraft to is interesting without having to co-opt the word planet, then they should have their spacecraft taken away from them. I mean, that's insane."" 
Brown also said the outcry isn't quite as loud as perhaps some people believe. 

""The only reason that it even sounds like there are people who are complaining … is because it's the same small group of people loudly complaining over and over the past decade.""
Brown and Benvenuti both say they're tired of the debate and wish it would just end. Benvenuti said he'd consider drafting another electronic vote of all the IAU members if such a proposal was put forward.
""I am tired because we are going nowhere,"" he said. ""I would be happy if that group who wrote the paper would instead make a proposal to us.""

But Stern said he has no intention of presenting the new paper to the IAU's general assembly.
Meanwhile, Brown would like the public to think about Pluto in a different light.
""Don't feel like you have lost Pluto as a planet,"" he said. ""Feel like you now suddenly realize that Pluto is one of these many thousands of objects that we know of in the outer solar system that we're just beginning to explore.""",2017-03-24T11:20:37Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/pluto-scientists-battle-planet-definition-1.4032382?cmp=rss

Mubarak's release also marked a new chapter in the saga of an ignominious fate of a president whose people rose up against him, demanding the end of a 30-year rule hollowed out by corruption, economic inequities and reliance on feared security officials to keep its hold on power.
It also underscored how the aspirations of the Arab Spring movement that swept the entire region have bottomed out. Six years on, the mass uprisings in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Yemen, Bahrain, and Syria have each failed in some way, leading to civil wars or failed states.
According to an Egyptian security official, Mubarak left the Armed Forces hospital in Cairo's southern suburb of Maadi earlier in the morning. From there, he went to his house in the upscale district of Heliopolis under heavy security measures.

Two groups of security forces secured the route from the hospital to his house, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media.
Mubarak's lawyer, Farid el-Deeb, refused to comment when contacted by The Associated Press.
The lawyer, however, told the Egyptian daily Al-Masry al-Youm that the ailing former president returned home with his two sons, Alaa and Gamal, and that the entire family, including Mubarak's wife Suzanne came together at his house to celebrate his return and have breakfast together.
The 88-year-old Mubarak was acquitted by Egypt's top appeals court on March 2 of charges that he ordered the killing of protesters during the 2011 popular uprising that led to his ouster.

At that point, he had already served a three-year sentence for embezzling state funds while in detention in connection with the case on the deaths of protesters. A criminal court had ruled in May 2015 to jail Mubarak for three years and fine him millions of Egyptian pounds following his conviction for embezzling funds earmarked for the maintenance and renovation of presidential palaces. The ruling was upheld by another court in January 2016.
Prosecutors, however, reopened another corruption case on Thursday, linked to allegations that Mubarak received gifts from the state-run Al-Ahram newspaper worth $1 million US, along with his family members. The case was closed before however the prosecutors appealed and the case restarted.
The order to release Mubarak was the latest in a series of court rulings in recent years in Egypt that acquitted some two dozen, Mubarak-era cabinet ministers, top police officers and aides charged with graft or in connection with the killing of some 900 protesters during the uprising.

Some of those acquitted have made a comeback in public life, while others partially paid back fortunes they illegally amassed.
Activists, meanwhile, say Mubarak's acquittal of killing protesters has confirmed long-held suspicions that his trial — and that of scores of policemen who faced trial on the same charge — would never bring the justice they demanded.
It has also, according to activists and Egypt's beleaguered rights campaigners, confirmed widely-held suspicions that their ""revolution"" — as the uprising against Mubarak was dubbed — had effectively been reversed by the government of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, a general-turned-politician, in order to restore the status quo in a country ruled undemocratically by men of military background for most of the past 60-plus years.
Powerful media figures loyal to el-Sissi have relentlessly vilified the 2011 uprising as a conspiracy and demonized its icons as foreign agents who pose a threat to the country's national security. The fallen protesters, contend some of them, were shot by members of the now-banned Islamist group, the Muslim Brotherhood.
The attacks began soon after el-Sissi, as army chief, led the 2013 ouster of the Brotherhood's Mohammed Morsi, after Mubarak Egypt's first freely elected leader whose one-year in office proved divisive.
Mubarak's sons were also convicted and sentenced to three years in prison in the same embezzlement case. They still face charges in an insider trading case, but both are free and have recently made a series of intensely publicized appearances greeted enthusiastically by hardcore supporters of their father.",2017-03-24T11:20:37Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/egypt-mubarak-released-1.4039234?cmp=rss

The report issued this week by the UN's senior resident official in Pyongyang said sanctions are inadvertently hindering legitimate operations on the ground and have indirectly contributed to a ""radical decline"" in donations it said are badly needed by millions of North Korean women and children.
It said ""chronic food insecurity, early childhood malnutrition and nutrition insecurity"" continue to be widespread in the North, which it noted ranked 98th out of 118 countries in the 2016 Global Hunger Index.
More than 10 million people — or about 41 per cent of the North Korean population — are undernourished, it said.
To meet the ""urgent needs of the most vulnerable,"" it called for $114 million in donations.

That could be a hard sell, no matter how dire the need.
Critics have long argued that aid to the North in effect serves to prop up the government by allowing it to focus more of its limited resources on building nuclear weapons, funding the country' million-man army or enriching the ruling elite, rather than spending on the segments of its population that are in the most need.
The report acknowledged such concerns have made getting donations increasingly difficult.
""The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is in the midst of a protracted, entrenched humanitarian situation largely forgotten or overlooked by the rest of the world,"" Tapan Mishra, who as resident coordinator in Pyongyang is responsible for UN development and other activities in the North, wrote in the report's introduction. ""I appeal to donors not to let political considerations get in the way of providing continued support for humanitarian assistance and relief.""
The report also noted sanctions are making it harder to conduct aid activities.
""While international sanctions imposed on DPRK clearly exempt humanitarian activities, they have unintentionally caused disruptions to humanitarian operations,"" it said.

In particular, it said the ""regular disruption"" of banking channels since 2013 has made it difficult or impossible to transfer funds into the country. It also cited the additional requirements for licences and the time it takes to determine what is or is not a potential sanctions' violation as the cause of considerable delays that have forced agencies to ""reprioritize"" their aid activities.
It said the sanctions also have the psychological effect of making donors reluctant to provide funds for projects in the North.
""This is reflected in the radical decline in donor funding since 2012,"" it said. ""As a result, agencies have been forced to significantly reduce the assistance they provide ... critical needs of some of the most vulnerable have not been met. More predictable funding is urgently required.""
Like previous years, the aid priorities for 2017 are to improve nutrition, particularly for pregnant and breast-feeding women, and children under the age of five; ensure access to basic health services for the most vulnerable members of society; and to bolster assistance to the victims of natural disasters, while strengthening efforts to lessen the impact of the country's recurrent cycle of floods and drought.

The report, which was released online this week, noted that despite the need for better information and sufficient access to certain areas of the country, aid agencies operating in North Korea believe monitoring mechanisms are sufficient to ensure aid does indeed go to those who need it.
The report was put together by five UN agencies, seven international non-governmental organizations and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.",2017-03-24T11:20:37Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/north-korea-un-poverty-levels-1.4039064?cmp=rss

At stake are billions of dollars, child labour, sexual violence, and the precious minerals that make our tech gadgets work.
Soon after Trump took office, his plan to suspend the law on what are known as conflict minerals was leaked to the media.

The law was part of former president Barack Obama's 2010 financial reform package known as the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 1502 of the act requires U.S. companies to avoid using conflict minerals from Congo and surrounding countries that are used to fund war, perpetuating human rights atrocities.
It also asked companies to track their global supply chains and provide independently audited reports to the Securities Exchange Commission.

Rights groups called the transparency law groundbreaking.
""The conflict minerals law is a vital way of breaking the chain between horrific human rights abuses in Central Africa and consumer products like smartphones,"" said Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty International's director of global issues.
Tantalum, tin, tungsten (the 3Ts) and gold — heavily mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) — are referred to as conflict minerals because of the immense profits they bring in helping warlords finance their wars with rival armies and the Congolese military.
The Enough Project, a Washington-based NGO, refers to what is happening in the DRC as the deadliest conflict since the Second World War, with more than 5.4 million people killed since the late 1990s and millions more displaced.
""The whole point of [Section 1502] was to remove the warlords,"" adds Joanne Lebert, executive director of Ottawa's non-profit Partnership Africa Canada. ""So this is going to send a signal that it's carte blanche. They can do whatever they want.""

Big business and some U.S. Republicans have spent years trying to get Section 1502 repealed or radically revised.
From the very beginning, then-chair of the SEC, Mary Jo White, said that while she personally would like to see an end to the human rights atrocities in the DRC, the new law seemed ""more directed at exerting societal pressure on companies to change behaviour, rather than to disclose financial information that primarily informs investment decisions.""

In May 2012, Franklin Vargo, vice-president of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the largest industrial trade group in the U.S., testified at a House subcommittee that while NAM also abhorred what was going on in the DRC, the new rules would pose a potentially huge financial burden on his membership.

Later that year, three of America's largest industry associations — NAM, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable (a group of top CEOs) — filed suit against the SEC, hoping to repeal the conflict minerals law.

They won a partial victory when the court ruled that the requirement to describe products as having ""not been found to be DRC conflict-free"" violates the First Amendment.
The rest of the law, involving documenting product supply chain and reporting to the SEC, was upheld in 2014 and then again in 2015.
As the legal battles were playing out, rights and development groups were working to let the public know what mining conditions are like in the DRC. Their highest profile campaigner was  actress Robin Wright.
Wright stars in a documentary called , the name taken from the African proverb, ""when elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers."" It means that in conflicts between the powerful, it is the weak who are hurt.

The film documents warlords using slave labour in the mines and children forced at gunpoint to dig with their hands for the minerals that fire up our smartphones and laptops.
""We are using these devices all day, every day, for our convenience and it's basically perpetuating a war,"" Wright said. ""I find it unacceptable that as consumers we allow this to go on.""

Sexual violence is also often fuelled by the militias and armies warring over conflict minerals, says The Enough Project's co-founder John Prendergast.
""The Congo war has the highest rate of violence against women and girls in the world,"" he said. ""And reports indicate that hundreds of thousands have been raped, making it the most dangerous place in the world to be a woman or girl.""

Softening the profits-over-people optics, tech giants Apple, Blackberry, Motorola and Intel have decided to move away from allowing conflict minerals into their products and toward using ethically mined 3Ts.

Intel made it clear the company wanted to be seen as a socially conscious industry leader. In early 2014, CEO Brian Krzanich announced that all of the company's microprocessors released that year would be free of conflict minerals.
""As a shareholder, you should care about this, you should want us to address it,"" Krzanich said in a keynote speech to the SEC. ""It did cost us a lot to set up this program, but now it's running, the cost of the actual materials is no more.""

After Trump's plan to suspend the conflict mineral law was leaked, Intel, Apple and a few other companies let it be known that regardless of whether the law was scrapped, they would continue sourcing only ethically mined minerals.
Jewelry giant Tiffany &amp; Co. also weighed in with a written statement urging U.S. Congress ""to support legislation that effectively promotes due diligence and transparency for the source of all conflict metals and gemstones.""

Six years later, inspectors determine which mines are ethically run or ""green"" and the specially tagged 3Ts are shipped to smelters that are part of the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI).
Companies are then expected to buy their supplies from only CFSI smelters.
The Enough Project's Sasha Lezhnev believes the system is working.
""In 2010, the UN said nearly every mine was controlled by a military actor,"" Lezhev says. ""Now 79 per cent of miners are working in mines that are conflict free.""

Evelyn Mayange, who is writing her PhD thesis on conflict minerals at the University of Manitoba, doesn't share that assessment. She says there is a desperate lack of independent monitors in the DRC, and that conflict minerals are smuggled into neighbouring countries and green-washed as they go.
There is corruption, she says, at every level.
""I interviewed custom officials, and two told me that when the minerals are brought from the mines, they're paid money and they just put a tag on the bags,"" said Mayange. ""Then they go as if they're conflict free.""
Having recently returned from a research trip to the DRC, Mayange argues that Section 1502 of Dodd-Frank needs to be strengthened, not struck down.
She says the mines need closer scrutiny on the use of child labour and sexual violence.
""Of the mines I visited, 50 to 70 per cent were children. Some are working as miners, some as porters, some in prostitution, and others are just there as beggars, looking for ways to survive,"" she said.

Still, many believe the U.S. conflict mineral law is a critical start. Dozens of human rights, social and religious groups in the DRC and neighbouring countries are pleading with the Trump administration to keep the regulation in place.

An open letter by Congolese civil rights leader Jamal Usseni Jamael read, in part, that suspending the Dodd-Frank rule ""will have negative consequences for millions"" in eastern DRC.
He said rebel groups will ""find the means"" to finance the war.
""They will kill the children, they will rape the women. They will destroy all hope for the Congolese people to live in peace in their own territory.""",2017-03-24T11:20:37Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-conflict-minerals-congo-1.4025968?cmp=rss

Brooks, the Pac-12 player of the year from Mississauga Ont., had 12 points along with four rebounds, and five assists, while Ennis of Brampton, Ont., chipped in with 10 points, five rebounds, and three assists. 
Tyler Dorsey led the Ducks in scoring with 20 points and made the go-ahead layup with 1:08 left.
""We lean on him right now,"" said Ennis. ""He's playing his best basketball, and it's coming at the right time.""
Dorsey, the man the Ducks call ""Mr. March,"" had his sixth straight game scoring 20 or more points.
The Wolverines (27-11) had one more chance to extend their run after Ennis missed a free throw with 15 seconds left. But Derrick Walton, who had carried the Wolverines the last three weeks, was off with his long jumper just before the buzzer.
Jordan Bell had a double-double for the Ducks (32-5), with 16 points and 13 rebounds. 
Walton led the Wolverines with 20 points, eight assists and five rebounds, Zak Irvin had 14 of his 19 points in the second half and DJ Wilson had 12 points.
The Ducks' run to the regional final has come without Canadian big man Chris Boucher, who went out in the Pac-12 Tournament semifinals with a season-ending knee injury. Oregon had plenty of inside game without Boucher, outscoring the Wolverines 34-16 in the paint and outrebounding them 36-31.
Oregon plays Kansas or Purdue on Saturday in the regional final.

Trevon Bluiett scored 25 points, Sean O'Mara scored inside with 40 seconds left and No. 11 seed Xavier upset No. 2 Arizona 73-71 in the West Region.
Xavier (30-13) stayed with the second-seeded Wildcats behind Bluiett's 18 first-half points and tracked down the Wildcats after they tried to pull away in the second half. O'Mara scored on a power move inside, but missed a free throw to give Arizona (32-5) a final chance.
Allonzo Trier missed a three-pointer in the closing seconds and Xavier was able to dribble out the clock, earning its first trip to the Elite Eight since 2008.
The Musketeers held Arizona scoreless over the final 2:52 to earn a sport in the West final against No. 1 seed Gonzaga on Saturday.
Trier scored 15 of his 19 points in the second half and Dusan Ristic had 17 for Arizona.




Jordan Mathews hit the go-ahead 3-pointer with under a minute to play and top-seeded Gonzaga survived a rough shooting night for both teams to beat No. 4 seed West Virginia 61-58 to advance to the West Regional final.
On a night that featured 51 fouls and only 34 made baskets, Mathews delivered the big shot that sent the Bulldogs (35-1) to their third Elite Eight in school history.
It didn't come easily. West Virginia (29-8) had three shots to tie the game but Tarik Phillip missed a shot from the lane and Jevon Carter missed two 3-pointers after Silas Melson made one foul shot. The Mountaineers rebound both misses but couldn't get another shot off before the buzzer.

Player of the year front-runner Frank Mason III poured in 26 points, Kansas turned on the jets in the second half and the top-seeded Jayhawks soared to a 98-66 blowout of No. 4 seed Purdue on Thursday night in the Midwest Regional semifinals.
Devonte Graham also had 26 points and Josh Jackson had 15 points and 12 rebounds for the Jayhawks (31-4), who led by 7 at halftime before their up-and-down pace finally wore down the Boilermakers.
Kansas used two big runs, including an 11-0 charge highlighted by Lagerald Vicks' 360-degree drunk, to coast into a matchup with No. 3 seed Oregon on Saturday for a spot in the Final Four.

That's according to Mounties who recently left or are preparing to leave Canada's national police force and who spoke to CBC News.
""I never realized how much fear I had going to calls for service with the RCMP,"" said one seven-year veteran who left for another agency in Western Canada last October.

CBC News has agreed not to identify any of the men for fear of jeopardizing their employment. Mounties are specifically prohibited from speaking to reporters without permission.
The officer said he started thinking about leaving after three years' service in Alberta, once he became fully aware of, as he put it, a ""cut-throat culture"" where he felt training, promotions and transfers were awarded based on favouritism. 

The ex-Mountie said he then grew anxious responding to calls alone when front line vacancies weren't filled. 
""There's a lot of things that my new employer recognizes as a dangerous situation, so they utilize their [emergency response team] to do those jobs, as opposed to ... the RCMP,"" he told CBC News.
Sgt. Chris Nesbitt oversees recruitment for Calgary Police and said the ""vast majority"" of experienced hires are Mounties. 
""They usually say that their main reason for looking to a municipality is for wellness and lifestyle for them and their family,"" said Nesbitt.
Experienced recruits are a bonus for any municipal or provincial agency. 
""For us specifically, knowing what your powers of arrest are and how to deal you know compassionately and appropriately with people … that sort of liability for a brand new person is taken away with an experienced police officer because they've been there, they've done that,"" said Nesbitt. 

No one at the RCMP acknowledged or responded to our phone, email and Access to Information requests for data on how many Mounties are turning in their red serge.
However, last month RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson told a committee of Senators that he's concerned about employee retention.
Paulson said the force is seeing members leave to go to work for municipal forces, including those in Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton. 
""It is a real drain on our existing resources,"" the commissioner said. ""We are always in competition with other police forces.""
One former RCMP employee told CBC News little was done to discover why he was moving on to another job.

""Not one person, not even in management, asked me why I was leaving,"" said one ex-Mountie, who started working for a municipal police force in B.C. last December after four years with the RCMP.
The officer told CBC News his greatest concern was the RCMP's new recruiting standards, which he said are too low. But since he started the new job he's been struck by the positive morale, high visibility of upper management and how specialized units take over anything that's out of the ordinary.

""I'm still in a uniformed unit, I'm on patrol so I'm on the road 90 per cent of the time and paperwork is a lot more efficient and a lot less. And like I said, the morale … everyone's having a good time.""

Calgary and the Ontario Provincial Police hire the most Mounties, but refused to disclose how many they've hired.
OPP Sgt. Peter Leon said his agency would not share the information ""out of fairness"" to the RCMP. 
Mounties told CBC News they're also attracted to other forces because they're disappointed with their work tools and equipment. Many said body armour, firearms and vehicles are newer at other police forces.
RCMP members have been especially critical of the  and hard body armour. 

One man who plans on applying for jobs with Vancouver, Calgary or Winnipeg city police by this summer, said that in his eight years on the job he spent roughly $1,500 on work-related gear such as warm-weather clothing.

""You look at Calgary for instance, they're given top of the line gear… stuff we have to buy on our own,"" said the Mountie currently stationed in Alberta.
""The flashlight they issue us is absolutely abysmal. It's a little twisty flashlight that's really cheap and unsafe to use. Whereas everybody buys their own Fenix brand higher-end tactical flashlight that's necessary for the job.""
The former Mountie who left last October said his new patrol rifle has a flashlight mounted on it. Not only that, he said, his new body armour fits him perfectly. 
""They size every single member so 100 per cent get custom-made vests,"" he said. 

None of the men interviewed by CBC cited their RCMP salaries as a primary reason for leaving the force.
Yet on average, Mounties at the rank of first-class constable make $20,000 less than colleagues at Calgary, Edmonton or Vancouver police forces.
In its campaign, Edmonton Police Service highlights  that resonate with Mounties:

Mounties have repeatedly told CBC News they are often asked to , or are not given the choice to work extra hours due to so many vacancies on the front lines. 
""It's tailored to any experienced officer from across the country, it's not specifically RCMP at all,"" said Edmonton Insp. Scott Jones.
With years of operational experience along with basic training at their previous agency, Jones said it's far more cost-efficient to bring in and train another cop.
The campaign caught Paulson's attention last week. 



Treasury Board, which manages the federal government's spending, has offered Mounties a 1.25 per cent wage hike every year for four years. As the RCMP remains the only major police force in Canada without a union, Paulson has turned down the offer on their behalf.
The ex-Mountie in B.C. said he wasn't too concerned about his pay at the RCMP but said his former colleagues would welcome a raise.
""Like, that would be the quickest thing to get people to kind of forget about all the other problems in the RCMP.""",2017-03-24T11:20:37Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-mounties-leaving-jobs-police-1.4037752?cmp=rss

But to the list of lamentable things might now be added the latest attempt at parliamentary reform, an effort that seems in danger of being strangled by parliamentary democracy.
Our current tale of woe begins, as many do, with a .
 , the House leader for the Liberal government, released such a document two weeks ago on the subject of the ""Modernization of the Standing Orders of the House of Commons.""
Conservatives and New Democrats immediately raised concerns with some of the ideas contained therein.

But the real fun began earlier this week, when a Liberal member of the procedure and House affairs committee — Scott Simms — moved to have the committee, which was already reviewing the standing orders, study the government's paper over the next two months and report back with recommendations in June.
Arguing that the government was moving to ram its proposals through, opposition MPs moved to filibuster the meeting, preventing the motion from coming to a vote. The proceedings have been suspended periodically to allow MPs to vote and sleep, but otherwise Conservative and NDP MPs have taken turns talking out the clock, filibustering through Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. 
Citing precedent, opposition MPs are demanding the Liberals agree to not proceed with any changes to the rules of the House unless there is unanimous support for those reforms. The Liberals are so far unwilling to provide such assurances.
The conflict spilled over to the House of Commons, with the prime minister accused of being a  and opposition MPs using procedural tactics and interruptions to delay the tabling of the budget on Wednesday.

Beyond the question of how the changes might be implemented, there are complaints about the : that changing question period to dedicate one session each week to questions for the prime minister, eliminating Friday sittings or reorganizing debate might diminish the opposition's ability to hold the government to account.
In some ways it might go too far; in others it might not go far enough.
There is perhaps some irony in the Conservatives complaining that another party is threatening to run roughshod over Canadian democracy after a time in government that included:

Turnabout being fair play, both interim Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose and NDP Leader Tom Mulcair asked the prime minister on Wednesday what he would have said if Stephen Harper had released the same discussion paper. (Chances are, an eyebrow would have been raised.)
But the existence of irony doesn't necessarily disqualify questions, complaints or ideas. And there is much in the Liberal paper that deserves consideration.
Take, question period (please!).


There are arguments to be made for overhauling the Parliament's signature forum. The Liberals haven't yet made those arguments. But Conservative MP Michael Chong  when he first pushed for question period reform.
Chong would have lengthened the amount of time for each question and response, removed the power of party whips to determine who gets to ask questions and also moved to a rotation that had different ministers in the House to take questions on different days.
On the one hand, it is perhaps a credit to Canadian democracy that the entire cabinet is generally expected to be in question period most afternoons. On the other hand, it's debatable whether that's the best use of everyone's time.
Question period itself is 45 minutes. But the entire cabinet also generally spends an hour each day preparing for question period. And for all that, the minister might only take a few questions (or none at all) in a given session.
Adopting a weekly session dedicated to the prime minister could, conceivably,  than he does now. The weekly Prime Minister's Questions in the United Kingdom is a much-watched institution that is a proving ground for both the prime minister and his or her rivals.
Chagger clarified Thursday that the Liberals were not looking to have the prime minister take questions just once per week.
But the Canadian Parliament might borrow another mechanism from the British Parliament — the ""urgent question"" — that allows MPs to summon a minister to the House to take questions on a new matter of concern.
Oddly enough, when Chong put forward a motion calling for a study of his proposal in 2010, it received overwhelming support, including every Conservative MP in the House and all but two New Democrats. Now, the notion is caught up in partisan tumult.
But all that (and more!) could still be still considered by the procedure and House affairs committee. A grand bargain on comprehensively sprucing the place up could be hammered out.
If the filibuster ever ends.

But that the consideration of reform can quickly collapse into conflict was made apparent last year when a Liberal proposal to eliminate sparsely attended Friday sittings — so that MPs might more easily get back to their ridings and their families for the weekend — was framed by some as a matter of Liberals trying to get out of work.
The Liberals might have added to their woes now by reviving that proposal, alongside a proposal to limit ""obstructionist tactics"" at committee meetings that could undermine the opposition's ability to delay government action.

It's possible that the other parties are seizing an opportunity to undermine the prime minister's claim to doing politics differently.

She was 71 years old.
The official cause of death was 
The news — announced in  — though somewhat grim, came as something of a relief to market watchers who spent decades watching CSB's rise and fall.

Born in 1946 out of a previous program aimed at raising funds to support Canada's war effort, the upstart CSB took Canada by storm and soon became one of the most popular savings vehicles for an entire generation of baby boomers, who grew up watching her memorable — and often spectacular — performances.
After her grand debut, CSB quickly found fame as a payroll deduction, with more than 16,000 employers providing an easy and secure way for their employees to participate in the program.

She was popular from the start, but the heights she reached in mid-life were truly meteoric.
""I have a very clear memory of selling Canada Savings Bonds in 1981 with a 19.5 per cent interest rate,"" said David Baskin of Baskin Wealth Management in Toronto, a money manager who knew CSB well.
""Can you imagine that? It's almost impossible to believe."" 

Against the backdrop of sudden runaway inflation in the 1980s, CSB was a star among investment vehicles. Even removing the wild inflationary days of the early 1980s from the equation, CSB offered risk-free returns in the high single digits for decades.

She cranked out small,  a year for her first decade or so. By the time she reached adolescence, CSB was firmly in her heyday.
But she had even greater ambitions. For an entire generation of Canadians, their first exposure to the world of investing was a CSB that paid high single digits, and sometimes far more.

""Back in those days,"" Baskin recalled, ""nobody had mutual funds,"" and investing ""was unknown to the great part of the public.""
CSB changed all that. Simply by loaning money to the government, she enabled everyday Canadians to save for their financial futures — for the first time ever, really.
""They were a staple of a lot of people's financial planning for decades,"" Baskin said.
From precocious ingenue to fast-rising young adult, CSB continued to gain popularity through the 1970s, and by 1976, held almost half of all the government's total marketable outstanding debt.
She peaked with a box office draw of $55 billion in 1987. With a yield of nine per cent, it's not hard to see why everyone wanted a piece of her.
Despite a flashy ad campaign singing her praises, a swift and sudden decline soon followed. Before Ottawa pulled the plug on Wednesday, there was only about  worth of CSBs left. 


In the end, it wasn't just one ailment that felled CSB. In the face of online brokerages, she simply couldn't compete with shiny new starlets such as high-interest savings accounts and exchange-traded funds investors can buy and sell on their smartphone.
And she'd lost a lot of her former glory.
""The interest rate that the government is paying is now so tiny that nobody sees the point anymore,"" Baskin said of CSB's most-recent offering, which paid out a meagre 0.7 per cent return for 2016.

The pipeline had been blocked by President Barack Obama, who said that it would do nothing to reduce fuel prices for U.S. motorists and would boost emissions that cause global warming.

The new administration has said repeatedly that President Donald Trump supports the project. Trump signed an executive order in his first week in office that invited TransCanada to reapply for a permit and promised a decision within 60 days. The 60-day deadline on Trump's executive order expires Monday.
""Transcanada will finally be allowed to complete this long-overdue project with efficiency and with speed,"" Trump said in the Oval Office before turning to ask TransCanada CEO Russ Girling.



""Thank you very much for this opportunity, and we're not going to let you down sir,"" Girling told the president, who asked that the company ""hire thousands of Americans to build it.""​
While TransCanada has had countless kilometres of pipeline ready and waiting to start construction for years, it has committed to buy any additional pipes it needs for the project from U.S. companies.
While the project has received all the approvals it needs in Canada, very little of the construction has been completed there due to U.S. delays, so it's likely to require many kilometres worth of new pipeline material and many new jobs in Canada, too.
Canada's Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr also welcomed the news on behalf of Canada's federal government. ""Our government has always been supportive of the Keystone XL pipeline and we are pleased with the U.S. decision,"" Carr said.

""Keystone XL will create thousands of good, middle-class jobs for Canadians during construction.""

Awarding cross-border pipeline permits is technically the domain of the Secretary of State. However, in this case, The Associated Press reported Thursday that the decision would come from Undersecretary of State Tom Shannon because his boss, former oil executive Rex Tillerson, has recused himself from the decision.
The multibillion-dollar pipeline first pitched in 2008 would bring more than 800,000 barrels per day of heavy crude from Alberta  into Nebraska, linking to an existing pipeline network feeding U.S. refineries and ports along the Gulf of Mexico along the entire almost 1,900 kilometre route.


Despite getting the thumbs-up from the White House, the project still faces myriad hurdles.
TransCanada still does not have deals with all the landowners in Nebraska on the proposed route. The company also lacks a permit in that state and protesters promise they will try to stop the project. 
When the subject of hurdles came up on Friday, the U.S. president was glib: ""I'll call Nebraska,"" Trump said.
According to a report by Platts Analytics, the approvals process could take another six months to a year, which would make the pipeline operational by ""late-2019 at the absolute earliest.""
""With much uncertainty remaining around whether Energy East pipeline will ultimately be approved, the appeal of moving forward with Keystone XL becomes all the more evident,"" Platts said.
TransCanada said Friday it would continue to work with key stakeholders throughout Nebraska, Montana and South Dakota to obtain the necessary permits and approvals to advance the project to construction.
Investment bank RBC Capital Markets said, while the project still faces doubt, ""receiving the permit is a good step forward for the project that could provide visible growth in the 2020 time frame.""",2017-03-24T11:20:37Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/keystone-xl-ok-state-department-transcanada-1.4039176?cmp=rss

The annual increase in the cost of living was largely fuelled by gas prices. Consumers paid 23.1 per cent more for gasoline in February, compared to the same month last year.
Gasoline prices also showed an increase in January's inflation report, which Statistics Canada attributed to higher oil prices and .
If the impact of gas prices is stripped out, said Statistics Canada, the inflation rate was 1.3 per cent in the year to February. That's still slightly less than January's 1.5 per cent pace when gas is excluded.
""In other words,"" wrote Scotiabank economist Derek Holt in a note to clients, ""after removing what you pay to fill your gas tanks, there is scant evidence of inflationary pressures in Canada.""

The increase in gasoline prices was partly offset by an annual decline in food prices. Canadian consumers paid 2.3 per cent less for food in February 2017, compared to a year before.
A 14 per cent annual decrease in the price of fresh vegetables ""contributed the most to the decrease,"" said Statistics Canada.  Prices of fresh fruit were down 13.3 per cent on an annual basis.
""The year-over-year declines in the fresh vegetables and the fresh fruit indexes partly reflect a spike in their prices last winter,"" said Statistics Canada.
That  was due to a weak Canadian dollar, which drove up the cost of imported food. A drought in California also increased the prices of some produce last year.

Only one province, Manitoba, saw its annual inflation rate heat up, from 2.1 to 2.3 per cent. In Ontario and British Columbia, the pace stayed the same, at 2.3 per cent.
Inflation rates ticked lower in all other provinces.

The Bank of Canada recently changed the way it measures core inflation, which removes volatile items that can lead to big monthly swings, and now uses three core inflation measures. The Bank of Canada watches core inflation closely in deciding its course on interest rates.
The average of the Bank of Canada's three core inflation measures in February was 1.6 per cent annualized.
""Soft core inflation is just one additional reason for a fairly dovish BoC outlook and for betting against rate hike pricing,"" wrote Scotiabank's Derek Holt.
TD economist James Marple agreed, writing that ""investors may be over pricing the chance of a rate hike.""
""Consistent with gradual absorption of economic slack, we do not expect the central bank to step off the sidelines until well into 2018,"" wrote Marple.",2017-03-24T11:20:37Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/inflation-rate-february-1.4039244?cmp=rss

Like most other social media companies, Twitter since its founding 11 years ago has focused on building a huge user base for a free service supported by advertising. Last month it reported it had 319 million users worldwide.

But unlike the much-larger Facebook Inc, Twitter has failed to attract enough in advertising revenue to turn a profit even as its popularity with U.S. President Donald Trump and other celebrities makes the network a constant center of attention.
Subscription fees could come from a version of , an existing interface that helps users navigate Twitter.
Twitter is conducting a survey ""to assess the interest in a new, more enhanced version of Tweetdeck,"" spokeswoman Brielle Villablanca said in a statement on Thursday.
She went on: ""We regularly conduct user research to gather feedback about people's Twitter experience and to better inform our product investment decisions, and we're exploring several ways to make Tweetdeck even more valuable for professionals.""
There was no indication that Twitter was considering charging fees from all its users.
Word of the survey had earlier leaked on Twitter, where a journalist affiliated with the New York Times posted screenshots of what a premium version of Tweetdeck could look like.
That version could include ""more powerful tools to help marketers, journalists, professionals, and others in our community find out what is happening in the world quicker,"" according to one of the screenshots posted on the account @andrewtavani.






The experience could be ad-free, the description said.
Other social media firms, such as Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn unit, already have tiered memberships, with subscription versions that offer greater access and data.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, Twitter posted the slowest revenue growth since it went public four years earlier, and revenue from advertising fell year-over-year. The company also said that advertising revenue growth would continue to lag user growth during 2017.

The nuns rarely used ""elderspeak"" — a loud, slow, simple, patronizing and common form of baby talk for seniors.
Instead, Corwin reports, they told jokes, stories and blessed the sick nuns, all the while speaking to them like they were completely capable, even though their ability to communicate was significantly diminished.
""It is beautiful watching these nuns,"" Corwin, a professor at Saint Mary's College of California in Moraga, said in a phone interview. ""They accept decline. They value a person in a sort of inherent way.""

Corwin observed the nuns caring for their infirm sisters from 2008 until 2013. Altogether, she spent 10 months watching and listening.
In a paper published in , she dissects the verbal interactions of caregiving nuns ministering to their elders during 26 visits that she recorded. Three caregivers visited 12 sick nuns, between the ages of 81 and 92, in their rooms, where they were bedridden or confined to reclining chairs, for 10 to 25 minutes at a time.
The nuns in the infirmary suffered from dementia, Alzheimer's disease, aphasia, stroke and neurological deterioration, and all had limited or impaired communication abilities. Sometimes the caregiver nuns held the sick nuns' hands, and sometimes they massaged their legs, Corwin said.
During all her visits over seven years, only twice did she hear elderspeak in the convent, and both times the words came from the same caregiver.
Elderspeak, often punctuated with terms of endearment like sweetie and dear, can communicate a message of incompetence to patients and can lead to a downward spiral of social isolation and cognitive decline, previous studies have shown.

Kristine Williams, a professor at the University of Kansas School of Nursing in Kansas City, trains nursing home providers to use less elderspeak. Her studies found that communication training can reduce the number of diminutives, terms of endearments and collective pronouns senior caregivers use.
""It's easy to say, 'Don't use elderspeak,'"" Williams said in a phone interview. ""But what is more effective to use?"" 
Corwin's observations provide alternative ways of communicating, though the nuns may be uniquely skilled, said Williams, who was not involved with the new study.
""Specifically, the jokes and narratives could be helpful to providers in a lot of different settings,"" she said.
The caregiver nuns had long-established deep relationships with their elder charges, Williams noted. ""They are in almost a family-like relationship, as opposed to someone who's a nursing assistant in a home,"" she said.
The lessons might apply to relatives talking to family members with dementia and other cognitive impairments.
A nun who Corwin calls Sister Irma provides an example of how the sisters used humour to diffuse memory lapses.
An elderly nun Corwin calls Sister Julette knew Sister Irma for more than 40 years, but Sister Julette could not remember her name.
""And I forgot your name,"" she says.
""Irma,"" Sister Irma responds.
""Irma,"" Sister Julette repeats.
""We used to play cards together,"" Sister Irma says.
""Irma?"" Sister Julette asks.
Sister Irma offers her last name, and Sister Julette repeats it. Then Sister Irma adds: ""Sister Irma. Sometimes some of them call me Fatty Irma or Ratty Irma or Bratty Irma. I get all kinds. But then I give 'em right back.""
Instead of feeling bad about forgetting her friend's name, Sister Julette winds up laughing, and Sister Irma laughs along with her. ""
""There's really something about the way the nuns see their older peers that I think is motivating these linguistic interactions,"" Corwin said. ""They see these older adults, even when they're lying in bed moaning and can't move, as not being reduced by these chronic conditions but still as whole individuals.""",2017-03-24T11:20:37Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/nuns-elderly-1.4039508?cmp=rss

Ontario's Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act governs how agencies respond to natural disasters in the province. An operations centre supports municipalities in managing situations once a state of emergency is declared.
First Nations in the Treaty 3 and Treaty 9 areas of Ontario are meeting with government officials in Thunder Bay, Ont., this week to develop similar protocols for dealing with ""social emergencies.""

""Right now people are just all over the place, and that's where a lot of confusion and frustration comes in"" when a crisis hits, said Jonathan Solomon, grand chief of the Mushkegowuk Council, which represents seven First Nations, including Attawapiskat, which declared an emergency over suicides in 2016.

""It would bring more of a sustainable plan. Instead of spending $2 million to send an EMAT [Emergency Medical Assistance Team] into Attawapiskat for a few days and then they're gone and communities are left without anything,"" he said.

An earlier meeting about social emergencies resulted in this draft working definition: ""An event or situation, with the exception of natural disasters requiring community evacuations, that exceeds the resources and capacities of a community and requires the immediate response and support of external agencies and service providers.""

For Randy Knapaysweet, that includes ""housing, suicide, water — everything that you've been seeing in the papers and everything people have been fighting for. Those are all social emergencies.""
The 28-year-old from Fort Albany First Nation was part of a youth panel at this week's meeting and pressed leaders to take preventive steps.
""Why wait for an emergency?"" he said. ""Work with your youth. Work on these things and don't wait for it to be an emergency.""
But Solomon believes a co-ordinated response to social emergencies would bring the resources to prevent future emergencies.
""This would bring training, programs for the front-line workers to continue to work on the situation,"" he said.

The youth panellists said they want a response to social emergencies that strengthens the ties between young people, their community, their elders and their language


Abbii Copenace, 20, said that's what saved her life when she attempted suicide five years ago in her community of Onigaming First Nation.



Health-care workers from Onigaming came to see her in hospital and ""they talked to me and they asked me what can we do to help you so this doesn't happen again,"" she said.
""All those community supports came together when I was in need, and when this happened to me, everyone was open and everyone helped me,"" Copenace said.
Now she runs a regular activity night for other youth in her community and regularly attends the traditional ceremonies in Onigaming.
Copenace acknowledges that her First Nation is a healthy community with the capacity to help young people. 
Others, especially remote First Nations, need help to do that.
""It's really challenging, coming from a First Nations level, you're limited, very limited, on resources and there's just so much you can do,"" Knapaysweet said.
Solomon believes a social emergency plan could change that with targeted investments in times of crisis — and create a template for First Nations and governments across the country to work together.

""Being able to play that with my friends and not have a disability hinder my playthrough, it was amazing,"" said Steve Saylor, a blind gamer from Toronto.
He said the 1-2 Switch contains unique features that make it possible for him to play. 
""The text was really big on screen. I can sort of stand back and read it without any problems. And for them to describe things in audio on how to play certain games is really great,"" he said.
Saylor has a condition called nystagmus which causes involuntary eye movement and makes it hard for his eyes to focus.

His vision is severely impaired — even with glasses on, something that's six metres away looks like it's 60 metres away. 
When he plays video games, he stands just over half-a-metre away from a big-screen TV.
Saylor likes to play story-based games such as the massively popular The Last of Us, Witcher 3 and Mass Effect. Role-playing games usually move at a slower pace and don't rely a lot on hand-eye coordination, Saylor said.


""Anything that's like an Assassin's Creed or a Skyrim where essentially it's a lot of text and a lot of complex movements that you have to make, it's hard for me to get through…because I don't have that eye-hand co-ordination that other people do,"" he said.
He likes first-person shooters such as Call of Duty and Battlefield.
Even if he's not particularly good at a game, he will still post his playthrough to his  as part of a series he calls Blind Gamer. His channel is meant to show that blind people can play video games, too.

Saylor said he likes playing mainstream games as opposed to audio games, which are targeted to blind and visually impaired people, because he can play mainstream games with or alongside his friends. 

""It levels the playing field and it allows for a small moment in time for someone with a visual disability to actually kind of feel normal in a way,"" he said.
""Not to say that we're not normal, but it allows us to feel like we're gamers, too. We want to be able to play these games. I really hope developers can see that and develop that further.""

Electronic Arts, one of the world's largest gaming companies, is working on incorporating accessible features in its games. This would help the roughly half a million Canadians and 25 million Americans who have significant vision loss.


Karen Stevens, an engineer for Madden NFL, has recently taken on the role of an accessibility advocate for EA. She's the one responsible for the accessibility features in Madden. 

In her role, she reaches out to visually impaired gamers to find out how to make their games more inclusive. 



""We have brightness and contrast support to help people with low vision. In the same line we also added in a resize feature so icons on the field — like pass icons — catch icons were about twice as tall and twice as wide as an option so people could see them easier,"" she said.

The reason EA is doing this is simple, she said: The company wants people to be able to play the games it makes.

As for the future of accessible games, Saylor said virtual reality may be a good option for visually impaired and blind gamers.

The first time he tried virtual reality was also the first time he was able to play a video game without his glasses because the screen was so close to his face. 

""It makes it so much easier, more accessible. That's kind of where accessibility can be pushed, and I hope that it can be pushed in that direction,"" Saylor said.
One company that has successfully created an inclusive VR experience is The Campfire Union in Winnipeg. 
Campfire created a 360-degree video for the Canadian Museum for Human Rights that brings viewers into two women's co-operatives in Guatemala.
The video was closed-captioned, bilingual and tested to make items in the video distinguishable for those who are colour blind.
It also featured hands-free navigation that's equivalent to a mouse pointer, so viewers could select items in the video just by staring at them.  



These are the kinds of features John Luxford, chief technology officer at The Campfire Union, hopes to see in the future. 
Virtual reality is still in its infancy and has no real standards to dictate things like how players need to interact with items or how they should move around, he said.
""This gives us an opportunity to look at inclusiveness and look at accessibility right off the hop and design those things deliberately and from the start,"" Luxford said. 
""I think what will happen is for the next few years it's probably going to be somewhat of a Wild West, and you're not going to see a lot of commonality between things. Then standards will start to emerge. And I'm hoping one of those is a strong emphasis on inclusiveness.""",2017-03-24T11:20:37Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/blind-video-gamers-1.4037944?cmp=rss

Researchers are developing ""prism-goggles"" to help patients experiencing hemi-spatial neglect as a result of an injury to the right side of the brain, most commonly from stroke.
""They have trouble paying attention to the left side of the world or their body, so they're basically not taking in information from that side of the world,"" Dr. Gail Eskes, a clinical neuropsychologist and professor at Dalhousie University, told CBC's . ""It's not that they can't see it and it's not that they can't move in that direction, but somehow they spontaneously seem to forget about it.""
Symptoms include bumping into objects or people on the left, or not being able to perceive the left side of a clock. 

With glasses that contain prisms made by Halifax company Eyes on Optometry, researchers are helping patients to pay attention to the left sides of their bodies. 

The glasses do this by first shifting the wearer's world to the right of where it actually is.
The wearer then goes through exercises, such as throwing bean bags into a bowl or pointing accurately to objects on a screen, using an app researchers have created for that purpose.
""Your normal eye-hand coordination is wrong and you make mistakes that are directed to the right because that's what your visual field looks like right now,"" said Eskes. ""Gradually though, the brain can learn to adapt to this distorted visual field, and it basically makes leftward corrections to do that learning""
As the brain adjusts to the left, the patient can point or throw beanbags accurately, even with the glasses on.

But when they take the glasses off, that leftward correction means that the patient will make mistakes again, throwing the bean bag or pointing too far to the left. 
""Now the key thing here is that that leftward bias now is good for people who have [hemi-spatial neglect] because they're already ignoring the left, so now we've basically brought the leftward information into their field of view.""
The correction isn't permanent. Eskes said current research suggests that two weeks of training can give users the ability to perceive the world on their left side for up to five weeks 

But the best option may be shorter increments of consistent training, and researchers have anticipated that. 
""This is why we've developed these goggles and we've developed an app to help you with the training when you've got the goggles on, because then you can just take it home and you can do it on a daily basis."" 
""It takes 10 minutes to do the training, and then you'll be centred for the day, and then hopefully as time goes on the brain is going to gradually recover and relearn and continue doing what it's supposed to do.""",2017-03-24T11:20:37Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/brain-injury-goggles-dalhousie-1.4038194?cmp=rss

Shortly after moving to Los Angeles in the early 1990s at the age of 21, the young actor was cast in a new kids' show.

It was called  and it became an instant hit.

Johnson, who played Kimberly Hart, the Pink Ranger, describes herself as having been ""an insecure, naive young girl"" at the time, totally unprepared for what would come.

In early 1994, the Rangers made their first live appearance, performing acrobatic stunts and answering fan questions at Universal Studios in Los Angeles. They filled the 4,000-seat amphitheatre four times over. More than 35,000 people flocked to the park, far more than organizers anticipated.
Merchandise stands were mobbed. The freeway was backed up for miles. It was nearly too much for Johnson to handle.



""It was a live show, so we had to, like, stand on top of a huge 20-foot tower and pull off our helmets, and the entire audience started to scream like we were rock stars,"" she recalled.



""I went home that night and had horrible nightmares — horrible nightmares. It just threw me for a loop,"" she said. ""I realized, in that moment, that I don't want to be famous. I don't want to be a superstar with huge fame. I think it is a strange thing to have people that you don't know, know you.""

It was a rude awakening for a young actor in her first role, but Johnson turned it into a launching pad for a fulfilling career — never far away from that pink spandex uniform, but neither held back by it.
And while it made her think twice about staying in the show business, it ultimately led to more varied and rewarding work.

And it was aided in part by her exodus to Canada.


Stage fright wasn't the only tough part of the job for Johnson in those early days. Stories of low pay and workplace harassment have trickled out over the years as former Rangers have spoken out in interviews and at fan events.


""It was a non-union show,"" said Johnson. ""At the time, being 21 years old, it was more money than I had ever made, but we were paid a ridiculously low amount of money by industry standards.""

Multiple Rangers were replaced after demanding higher wages. David Yost, the Blue Ranger, who later came out as gay, said he quit the show after enduring homophobic slurs from the crew.
, Johnson wrote that in addition to being paid ""peanuts,"" she ""almost died a few times because of the makeshift low-budget stunts we performed.""



Johnson left the series in 1995 after appearing in over 120 episodes, and arguably went on to the most successful acting career of anyone in the original squad. She landed a recurring role in , and counts  and among her other television and film appearances.


In 2005, she left Hollywood behind and moved to Canada to reevaluate her career.

""I just needed a break from L.A., and from the industry,"" she said. ""I extricated myself, and my entire life, to Montreal, wanting to take a break and look at if I even wanted to act anymore.""


It wouldn't be long before the cameras called again. She went on to co-star in the Toronto-based police drama for five seasons, earning a Gemini award nomination along the way.

""When carried me to Toronto, I really fell in love with Canada. Like, as soon as I got to Toronto, I was like, OK, I can make this place my home. This feels like home,"" she recalled.

She's been a Torontonian for the last eight years and received her Canadian passport in 2015, making her a dual Canadian-American citizen.




Getting away from the pressures of Hollywood also allowed her to explore a creative side beyond acting.

She has released three folk-rock albums and directed and produced two short films. Her first feature film, , is set to launch this summer.


Despite the rocky start, Johnson doesn't consider her legacy as a Ranger to be a burden on her career.
""Without even knowing it at the time, a way to inspire thousands of little girls to believe that they can be as badass as little boys. That, in itself, is priceless,"" she wrote in her Variety column.

At a press junket for the new film, she surprised the cast — including Naomi Scott, who plays the new Kimberly — by appearing as a reporter for an interview.

Parker Bright spent several days this week standing in front of the painting by Dana Schutz, who used historic photographs as inspiration for her depiction of Till, a 14-year-old black Chicago boy killed by white men in Mississippi in 1955.
Till's mother insisted on an open-casket funeral to show the world the mutilated body of her son, and Jet magazine published photos of his corpse. The brutality sparked outrage that helped galvanize the civil rights movement.

In an , Schutz said that when she made the painting last year, it was a response to ""a summer that felt like a state of emergency.""
""There were constant mass shootings, racist rallies filled with hate speech, and an escalating number of camera-phone videos of innocent black men being shot by police,"" she said.
""The photograph of Emmett Till felt analogous to the time: what was hidden was now revealed.""

, demanding that the curators remove the painting from the biennial exhibition.
Bright's protest found supporters online. A , sent the biennial curators a letter lambasting Schutz for using ""black pain as raw material."" She called on the museum to destroy the painting.

Whitney curators Mia Locks and Christopher Y. Lew, both Asian American, defended their inclusion of Schutz's ""unsettling image"" in the show.
""By exhibiting the painting we wanted to acknowledge the importance of this extremely consequential and solemn image in American and African American history.""
Locks said any attempt to shut down a conversation about art ""is a dangerous and slippery slope and feels to me like an affront to the belief in art and the capacity of art to hold all those complexities.""
Scott Rothkopf, the Whitney museum's chief curator, said the museum took pains to publicly acknowledge the controversy.

Schutz, who didn't respond to interview requests from The Associated Press, said in a statement provided by the museum that  was an effort to ""engage with the loss.""
""I don't know what it is like to be black in America. But I do know what it is like to be a mother. Emmett was Mamie Till's only son. I thought about the possibility of painting it only after listening to interviews with her,"" she wrote.
She dismissed accusations of trying to profit from Till's killing, pledging that the painting ""was never for sale and never will be.""
The controversy was the subject of false news reports. Several websites circulated a bogus letter purporting to be from Schutz calling for the painting to be removed.

Whitney patron Robyn Autry, an African-American professor of sociology who came to see the painting from Connecticut, said viewing it was painful because of the subject material, but ""artists can do what they want. That has to be the case. But then people will respond to it however they will respond to it.""
Elias Schultz, a 20-year-old student from New York, said it's important to let everyone be heard.
""I don't think that Schutz is doing any harm by bringing more attention to the story of Emmett Till,"" she said.

Lately, the question has elicited some fiery exchanges between the scientists at the forefront of the argument.
Both sides claim to have great respect for the other's work, but when you speak with them, they're quick to mock their opponents' views on the subject.
Take Mike Brown of the California Institute of Technology. He discovered Eris, the celestial body located beyond Pluto that stirred up the debate about what constitutes a planet and ultimately led to the International Astronomical Union's vote in 2006 that demoted Pluto from planet to dwarf planet.
He calls some pro-planet Pluto arguments ""insane.""

Then there's Alan Stern, principal investigator of New Horizons, the spacecraft that flew by Pluto in 2015. He believes astronomers had no business voting on what constitutes a planet in the first place: ""We're called planetary scientists because we study planets. It's part of the title of our profession. We know what we're doing.""
Piero Benvenuti, general secretary of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), places the blame for the decade-old debate squarely on Stern and suggests few people actually support his cause. When asked why the debate has lasted so long, Benvenuti told CBC News: ""Because of Alan Stern. Because of the Horizons team … Why am I not getting French schoolboys or Italian schoolboys or Iranian schoolboys writing to me about Pluto?""


A paper Stern co-wrote provided a new attack in the Great Pluto Debate when it was presented earlier this week at the Lunar and Planetary Sciences Conference in Texas. It proposes a new definition for the word ""planet.""
According to the IAU's criteria, a planet has to orbit the sun; have sufficient mass and self-gravity to form a round object; and clear its neighbourhood in its orbit. But Stern's new simplified definition says a planet only has to form a sphere under its own gravity and hasn't undergone fusion, like a star.
Except, that would add more than 110 planets to our solar system. And it would include our moon.
Brown thinks the idea is ludicrous. ""Nobody wants the moon to be a planet,"" he said with a laugh.

Stern has criticized the IAU vote for several reasons: only 424 of its 10,000 members voted; they weren't representative of planetary scientists, who are the experts on planets; and, he says, ""you don't legislate science.""
But Brown says Stern's opposition is only about the result, not the process: ""He would have no complaint about the voting if the voting had gone in the direction he wanted.""

Along with Brown, Neil deGrasse Tyson, the renowned astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City, gets blamed in some circles for Pluto's fall from grace.
In 2000, Tyson removed Pluto from the planetarium's display of the solar system, instead placing it out in its own category (the debate began a year later as a result of a ). He received plenty of hate mail, but it didn't faze him. For anyone who has a problem with Pluto's dwarf planet status, Tyson usually has the same reply: Get over it.



But Stern will have none of that. 
""Neil has a PhD in astrophysics. Wrong profession,"" Stern said. ""Neil will find, this time, that he's tangling with something he can't stop. And he's going to end up on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of science, and he'll end up having to apologize, because the field is laughing at him.""
Kirby Runyon, a planetary geologist and lead author of the new paper with Stern, said Tyson's arguments for not including Pluto as a planet can be proven incorrect. For example, Tyson said Pluto needed to be reclassified because of its odd orbital inclination —  it's on an inclination of 17 degrees compared to the rest of the planets —  its extreme elliptical orbit and because it would vaporize if it were to pass too close to the sun. 

""If you take any planet and move it too close to a star, it's going to vaporize. If Jupiter were in an elongated, elliptical orbit, it would still be considered a planet,"" Runyon said.
Though Runyon praises Tyson for his work bringing science to the masses, he said his arguments aren't up to his normal scientific standards.
""It's so easily rebutted,"" Runyon said. ""Look, Neil is an astrophysicist … I'm a planetary geologist. I actually study planets.""

So what's the big deal if Pluto is a planet or a dwarf planet? 
""What we call things affects how we think about them, how we intuit about them, how we compare it to other things that are similar or different,"" Runyon said.
For example, if Pluto doesn't have the prestige of being a planet, Runyon and Stern argue, that could affect the public's view of whether it's worth funding a mission to explore it.
Brown says that argument makes no sense. 
""If they can't make the case that the object that they sent their billion-dollar spacecraft to is interesting without having to co-opt the word planet, then they should have their spacecraft taken away from them. I mean, that's insane."" 
Brown also said the outcry isn't quite as loud as perhaps some people believe. 

""The only reason that it even sounds like there are people who are complaining … is because it's the same small group of people loudly complaining over and over the past decade.""
Brown and Benvenuti both say they're tired of the debate and wish it would just end. Benvenuti said he'd consider drafting another electronic vote of all the IAU members if such a proposal was put forward.
""I am tired because we are going nowhere,"" he said. ""I would be happy if that group who wrote the paper would instead make a proposal to us.""

But Stern said he has no intention of presenting the new paper to the IAU's general assembly.
Meanwhile, Brown would like the public to think about Pluto in a different light.
""Don't feel like you have lost Pluto as a planet,"" he said. ""Feel like you now suddenly realize that Pluto is one of these many thousands of objects that we know of in the outer solar system that we're just beginning to explore.""",2017-03-24T11:20:37Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/pluto-scientists-battle-planet-definition-1.4032382?cmp=rss

The 402-kilometre-high complex already has one docking port in place for the SpaceX Crew Dragon and Boeing Starliner, which should start carrying up astronauts as early as next year.  set the stage for a second docking location.
NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough disconnected all four cables from an old docking port, using some extra force on one. He looped a spare tether around the balky cable and pulled, and off it came.



""Nicely done, Shane,"" Mission Control radioed.
On Sunday, flight controllers in Houston, Texas, will move the old port to a location that will provide better clearance for the future ships. Then next Thursday, the crew will conduct another spacewalk to secure the unit.
A new docking device — similar to one installed last summer — will fly up late this year or early next, and hook onto this port.

As Kimbrough worked on the docking port and replaced a computer-relay box, Pesquet hunted for signs of an ammonia coolant leak in outdoor plumbing. The leak, while still small, has worsened recently, and NASA wants to pinpoint the location.

Pesquet patted and tugged at hoses, but did not spot any frozen flakes of ammonia. A GoPro camera caught his every move for playback later.
""No leaks. No flakes whatsoever,"" he reported.
Also on the spacewalkers' to-do list Friday: replace a pair of Japanese cameras and grease latching mechanisms on the end of the big robot arm.



NASA wants to cram in two and possibly three spacewalks before Kimbrough, the station's commander, returns to Earth on April 10.
Before a third spacewalk can be conducted, Orbital ATK needs to launch a cargo ship to the space station with replacement parts. That shipment was supposed to be there by now, but repeatedly has been delayed because of rocket concerns. It's unclear when the Atlas V rocket will be ready to soar from Cape Canaveral, Fla.
NASA has been contracting out cargo deliveries since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011. The space agency is counting on private companies to do the same with astronauts.",2017-03-24T11:20:37Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/friday-spacewalk-1.4039584?cmp=rss

Like most other social media companies, Twitter since its founding 11 years ago has focused on building a huge user base for a free service supported by advertising. Last month it reported it had 319 million users worldwide.

But unlike the much-larger Facebook Inc, Twitter has failed to attract enough in advertising revenue to turn a profit even as its popularity with U.S. President Donald Trump and other celebrities makes the network a constant center of attention.
Subscription fees could come from a version of , an existing interface that helps users navigate Twitter.
Twitter is conducting a survey ""to assess the interest in a new, more enhanced version of Tweetdeck,"" spokeswoman Brielle Villablanca said in a statement on Thursday.
She went on: ""We regularly conduct user research to gather feedback about people's Twitter experience and to better inform our product investment decisions, and we're exploring several ways to make Tweetdeck even more valuable for professionals.""
There was no indication that Twitter was considering charging fees from all its users.
Word of the survey had earlier leaked on Twitter, where a journalist affiliated with the New York Times posted screenshots of what a premium version of Tweetdeck could look like.
That version could include ""more powerful tools to help marketers, journalists, professionals, and others in our community find out what is happening in the world quicker,"" according to one of the screenshots posted on the account @andrewtavani.






The experience could be ad-free, the description said.
Other social media firms, such as Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn unit, already have tiered memberships, with subscription versions that offer greater access and data.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, Twitter posted the slowest revenue growth since it went public four years earlier, and revenue from advertising fell year-over-year. The company also said that advertising revenue growth would continue to lag user growth during 2017.

While prosthetics are usually fully powered using batteries, a new prototype from University of Glasgow researchers opens up the possibility for so-called ""solar-powered skin,"" which would include better sense capabilities than current technology.

""If an entity is going out in a sunny day, then they won't need any battery"" to activate their senses, said Ravinder Dahiya, a research fellow at the university and a leader of the study. ""They can feel, without worrying about battery.""
The technology involves installing a thin layer of pure carbon around a prosthetic arm, hand or leg. This allows light to pass through it and be easily used as solar energy, the researchers said in a research paper published this month in the journal .

The sun can provide up to 15 times more energy than is usually needed to power a prosthetic limb, Dahiya said. This extra — and renewable — energy can be used to power sensors that increase sensation and feeling in a limb, so much so that the prosthetic can feel pressure, temperature and texture like natural skin, the paper said.
""The skin is sensitive to touch and pressure, so when you touch the skin there you will know what point you are contacting and how much force you are applying,"" Dahiya said, describing the prototype.

The scientists are the first to develop a model for solar-powered prosthetic skin, he said.
The technology could also increase the functionality of robots, allowing them to have a better understanding of what they touch and interact with, according to Dahiya. If robots had limbs that are sensitive to touch and pressure they would be less likely to make errors or injure humans, he said.
The researchers hope to further develop the prototype in the next two years, Dahiya said.
Eventually, he hopes to power the limb's motors with the renewable energy as well — rather than just the skin.
""Because we are saving a lot of energy, our vision is that... if we store this energy in some way we will be able to also power the motors with the energy,""he said. ""The prosthetic will be fully energy autonomous.""",2017-03-24T11:20:37Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/solar-powered-skin-1.4039310?cmp=rss
81dc8d0cdbd3f7b3c21ef5c656ad6027efe354f1,Derek Stoffel,2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,'Clearly a war crime': International community denounces chemical attack in Syria but fails to act,"The images of the victims — including many children — foaming at the mouth and convulsing as they struggle to breathe after a suspected chemical weapons strike is a shocking reminder to the world that the long war in Syria is far from over. 
The attack Tuesday in the northwestern province of Idlib is believed to have killed at least 100 people, according to groups who monitor the war. More than 100 others were injured. 

The early morning air raid believed to have been carried out by Syria's military or its ally, Russia, also highlights the continued failure of the international community to stop the horrors of the conflict, which has raged for more than six years and left as many as 500,000 people dead. 
""The gas attacks are continuing every day and no one is doing anything to stop these gas attacks,"" said Dr. Shajul Islam, a British-trained physician who  Tuesday that appears to show patients from the attack being treated at a medical centre in Idlib province.

Chemical weapons experts say early analysis of the attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun points to the use of sarin gas, a nerve agent. The common symptoms — choking, convulsions and foaming at the mouth — were seen in Islam's video as well as others purporting to show the victims of the strike this morning.
It is a clear escalation in the long-running violence, even in a conflict where chemical weapons have been used many times.


The United Nations and the global chemical weapons watchdog, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons,  that the Syrian government used chlorine against civilians at least three times in 2014 and 2015. The same report also determined that ISIS used the blister agent sulphur mustard (commonly known as mustard gas) at least once.
From Damascus, the response has always been the same: a flat-out denial that the regime of president Bashar al-Assad has ever used chemical weapons, even in the face of facts that state otherwise. 

Witnesses in Khan Sheikhoun report seeing warplanes in the air just as Tuesday's strikes were carried out. Syrian opposition and rebel forces — including ISIS — do not have the ability to hit targets from the air. Syria's military and the Russian air force, stationed in Syria for more than a year and a half, do.

Assad blamed a 2013 chemical weapons strike on rebel fighters, even though the United States came forward with evidence that showed Syrian government forces were behind the deadliest use of chemical weapons during the war. The attack on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta left more than a thousand people dead.


The use of sarin gas in Ghouta crossed the ""red line"" drawn by Barack Obama. But instead of acting on the threat of military action, the former U.S. president agreed to a deal brokered by the Russians that saw Assad give up his chemical weapons stockpile.

Chemical weapons experts say Tuesday's attack appears to show that the Syrian regime did not hand over its entire stockpile to be destroyed.


The Ghouta incident ""led to the disarming of the chemical weapons arsenal possessed by Syria — which, unfortunately, has not been completed yet in actuality,"" said Dany Shoham, a former chemical weapons specialist for Israel's military, the Israel Defence Forces.

Analysts estimate that Assad's forces held onto about 10 per cent of the regime's chemical weapons.


The Syrian president is clearly emboldened by recent gains, most notably recapturing territory lost to rebels in Aleppo. His grip on power in Syria looks solid, largely because of the unflinching support of key allies such as Russia and Iran.

But a recent change in tone in Washington probably boosted Assad's confidence, as well.

Under the Trump administration, American policy on Syria is no longer focused on forcing Assad from power, a departure from Obama's long-held stance that the Syrian president cannot be a part of any political solution to end years of war.


""You pick and choose your battles. And when we're looking at this, it's about changing up priorities — and our priority is no longer to sit there and focus on getting Assad out,"" U.S. ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said recently.

Just days later, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Assad's fate ""will be decided by the Syrian people.""

The American shift puts the U.S. at odds with its European allies and Canada, which maintain that Assad has to go.

And that could complicate a global response to the alleged chemical attack in Idlib province. 


""This is clearly a war crime,"" the U.K.'s ambassador to the UN, Matthew Rycroft, said to reporters Tuesday. ""It demonstrates once again that the regime will stop at nothing to remain in power, even the most heinous use of weapons imaginable.""
Canada's minister of foreign affairs, Chrystia Freeland, said in a statement Tuesday: ""Not all the facts are yet available, but this deplorable incident is consistent with the actions of a regime that has brutally and repeatedly used chemical weapons against its own people.""

The UN Security Council is expected to hold an emergency session Wednesday to discuss the Khan Sheikhoun raid, but Russia could once again use its veto to protect president Assad.


The White House blamed the Syrian government for Tuesday's attack, calling it ""reprehensible.""
Despite that, President Trump's shift in policy on Syria has few expecting that the U.S. will establish a new ""red line"" on the use of chemical weapons in the conflict.

That has many battle-hardened medical workers and emergency responders in Syria worried that this latest attack will not be the last.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/syria-attack-1.4054869?cmp=rss

The launch comes just ahead of a summit meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping this week. It's expected the two will discuss adding more pressure on the North to drop its arms development.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson addressed the matter briefly in a written statement Tuesday evening.
""North Korea launched yet another intermediate range ballistic missile,"" he said. ""The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment.""

Trump and Xi are to meet on Thursday and Friday at Trump's Mar-a-Lago retreat on the Atlantic coast in Palm Beach, Florida.
It will be their first face-to-face meeting since Trump took office on Jan. 20, and trade and security issues are to figure prominently in their talks.
""We would like to work on North Korea together,"" the official said in a briefing for reporters, just as news of the latest projectile was breaking. ""This is a test for the relationship.""

Trump wants China to do more to exert its economic influence over unpredictable Pyongyang to restrain its nuclear and missile programs, while Beijing has said it does not have that kind of influence.
In an interview with the Financial Times last weekend, Trump held out the possibility of using trade as a lever to secure Chinese cooperation.
In the same interview, Trump was quoted as telling the FT that Washington was ready to address the North Korean threat alone, if need be.

The White House official said the situation had become more urgent. ""The clock is very, very quickly running out,"" the official said. ""All options are on the table for us.""
Trump does not plan to give in to Chinese pressure for the United States to withdraw its THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea, which Beijing considers destabilizing.
Trump has said he expects the meeting to be a difficult one given his belief that China has taken advantage of U.S. trade policies to help its economy and hurt U.S. job creation.
He plans to discuss with Xi a new ""elevated"" and streamlined framework for a U.S.-Chinese dialogue with ""clear deadlines for achieving results,"" the senior White House official said.
He will discuss significant trade and economic concerns with Xi in what the official called a ""candid and productive manner.""",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/north-korea-projectile-1.4055656?cmp=rss

Peace envoy in the Middle East. Top adviser on relations with Canada, China and Mexico. Head of White House bureaucratic ""innovation."" Why not add emissary to Iraq to the list?
It can be hard to keep track of all the sensitive jobs Jared Kushner has been given by his father-in-law, President Donald Trump. His latest mission involved a surprise visit to Baghdad, where the 36-year-old flew with the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in a covert trip to meet with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.
Last week, Kushner, who is married to the president's eldest daughter, Ivanka, was named to head a new White House ""innovation"" task force to fix the way government runs by using private-sector methods.
Together with the Iraq deployment, experts on governance say, Kushner's sphere of influence has ballooned into something so vast that it could eclipse other portfolios in the Trump administration. It's already among the most complicated, said Mark Peterson, who chairs the department of public policy at UCLA's Luskin School of Public Affairs.

""It certainly has many more dimensions,"" Peterson said in an interview Monday. ""Jared Kushner seems to be providing a significant oversight over a very large number of issues, on both the domestic and foreign side. He's supposed to be the point person on the Middle East peace process; the point person on our relations with China; now he's in Iraq.""



Kushner's appearance in Baghdad — a diplomatic tour that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has yet to make — suggested that he might be adding some of the secretary's responsibilities to his ever-expanding portfolio.

It can't have been a good sign from Tillerson's perspective, Ken Hughes, a governance expert with the University of Virginia's Miller Center of Public Affairs, told CBC News Monday.
""If I were the secretary of state, I would not be happy about that. I would consider that a sign of my relative unimportance.""

Not only is Kushner's role exceptional in its scope, but Hughes said it's also unheard of, given his lack of experience.
Kushner brings no diplomatic, military or foreign-policy track record to the Herculean tasks before him.
""Zero,"" Hughes said. ""I can't think of any precedent for it.""
Although Kushner's family has deep connections to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Peterson questioned the wisdom of trusting a political neophyte to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
""Now he's going to be running this office of American innovation? We had whole commissions in the past where the person was running that and not anything else.""

Kushner and Ivanka Trump, considered to be moderating voices the administration, were reportedly instrumental in persuading the president to cancel an executive order that would have rolled back rights protections for LGBT people.
Kushner also reportedly helped arrange Trump's Mar-a-Lago summit in Florida this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping and convinced the president to reaffirm the U.S. ""one China"" policy.

Hughes points out there's nothing particularly unusual about presidents having key confidantes act as chief diplomats. Henry Kissinger fulfilled such a role for president Richard Nixon, for example, and Bobby Kennedy served as an attorney general and close counsellor to his older brother president John F. Kennedy.
But while Kissinger's role as national security adviser was invaluable to Nixon, he was a Harvard professor of government and had previously negotiated for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration as a consultant. Bobby Kennedy had worked in the Department of Justice.
""So when they took on these added roles, they brought a lot of experience to the table,"" Hughes said. ""One can't say anything like that about Jared Kushner,"" whose background is in real estate and publishing.

He may still face ethical problems ahead, based on recent financial disclosures.
The New York Times reported last week that Kushner and Ivanka Trump retain property assets and investments worth as much as $740 million together. Their financial disclosures were required by law. As White House employees, the couple is subject to federal ethics rules.

Their business entanglements may prevent them from consulting the president on trade, tax reform and Wall Street deregulation,  in USA Today by former White House ethics counsellors Richard Painter, Norman Eisen and Virginia Canter.
""[T]here are still serious ethics concerns regarding the couple because (like the president) they have chosen not to divest all their assets or place them in a blind trust to be sold by the trustee,"" they wrote on Monday.
It may not prevent Kushner from pursuing some of his missions abroad for Trump, though he runs the risk of overshadowing Tillerson as secretary of state.
Hughes was reminded of the dynamic between Nixon's secretary of state during his first term, William Rogers, and Kissinger, who at the time was serving as national security adviser, a post that does not require Senate confirmation.
Kissinger nevertheless negotiated the exit of U.S. troops from Vietnam, the diplomatic opening of China, and arms control with the Soviet Union while serving as national security adviser.

""Rogers was very much a lesser player than Henry Kissinger, and it was sort of humiliating for Rogers,"" Hughes said.
He suggested that the ""Nixon administration analogy"" could be replaying in Trump's White House, with Kushner seeming to serve as a de facto secretary of state in place of Tillerson.
With regard to Iraq, what's remarkable ""is not that a person from the administration would show up unannounced,"" said Bill Galston, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a non-profit think tank based in Washington.
""What's remarkable is that this particular person would show up unannounced.""
Still, Galston said, Kushner wouldn't be the first new federal employee to wield extreme political influence at the White House, despite having no previous experience.
""Remember,"" he said, ""the president didn't either.""",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-jared-kushner-adviser-expanded-role-experience-1.4053990?cmp=rss

Automakers Hyundai and BMW, financial firm T. Rowe Price, insurer Allstate, drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline and online marketing firm Constant Contact said Tuesday that they have joined Mercedes-Benz in pulling their ads from the show.
The moves come after a weekend report in the New York Times that O'Reilly and his employer paid five women $13 million to settle harassment or other allegations of inappropriate conduct by Fox's star.

Hyundai said it currently has no ads on , but it pulled spots on future episodes. The automaker says it wants to partner with companies and programming that share its values of inclusion and diversity.
BMW said it suspended advertising on the show due to the recent allegations, as did T. Rowe Price and Constant Contact. Allstate said support for women is a company value and it had also suspended advertising on the show.
GlaxoSmithKline said it had ""temporarily put a hold"" on ads on O'Reilly's show while it reviews the situation.
A Mercedes-Benz spokesman said Monday night that the company had pulled ads from O'Reilly's show and reassigned them to other Fox News shows. BMW said it wasn't sure where it would place its ads instead.

O'Reilly is Fox News' top revenue producer, according to research firm Kantar Media, bringing in over $178 million in ad dollars in 2015 and $118.6 million in the first nine months of 2016.

The bomber, Akbarzhon Dzhalilov, had lived in St. Petersburg for several years, working as a car repairman and later at a sushi bar. Pages on his social media networks reflected his interest in radical Islam and boxing, but those who met Dzhalilov described him as a calm and friendly man.
Russia's health minister raised the death toll from 11 to 14, including the bomber. About 50 others remained hospitalized, some in grave condition. Many were students heading home Monday after classes on one of the city's busy north-south lines.
No one has claimed responsibility for , which came as President Vladimir Putin was visiting his hometown, raising speculation it could have been timed for his trip. The attack follows a long string of bombings of Russian planes, trains and transportation facilities. Many of the attacks were linked to radical Islamists.

Before Dzhalilov travelled to St. Petersburg where he eventually got Russian citizenship, his ethnic Uzbek family lived in Osh, the city in southern Kyrgyzstan that saw more than 400 people killed and thousands injured in clashes between ethnic Kyrgyz and minority Uzbeks in 2010.
St. Petersburg has a large diaspora of people from Kyrgyzstan and other mostly Muslim former Soviet republics in Central Asia. They have fled ethnic tension, poverty and unemployment for jobs in Russia. While most Central Asian migrants hold temporary work permits or work illegally, thousands have received Russian citizenship in recent decades.
Russian media said Dzhalilov worked with his father in a car repair shop and then became a cook at one of the city's many sushi bars. He stayed in St. Petersburg when his parents moved back to Kyrgyzstan.

One former colleague at the sushi chain described Dzhalilov, who turned 22 on Saturday, as ""a very kind person.""
""He was a non-conflict person. We didn't expect to hear such news today,"" said the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared for her personal safety.
Neighbours in Osh also described him as a nice and friendly man.
Dzhalilov visited his home country about a month ago, and unlike past trips when he travelled directly back to St. Petersburg, he returned via Moscow. Investigators are looking into whether he met possible accomplices in Moscow, according to Russian media reports.



Security cameras caught the bespectacled Dzhalilov as he entered the subway, appearing calm and clad in a red parka with a fur collar and blue wool hat. He wore a backpack believed to hold the bomb that was loaded with metal balls and screws for maximum damage.
The Investigative Committee, Russia's top investigative agency, said it also found Dzhalilov's DNA on a bag with a similar bomb that was found and deactivated at another subway station shortly after the blast.

Security experts have described people from Central Asia as fertile recruits for radical Islamist preachers, who have become increasingly active on social networks. Dzhalilov followed some radical Islamist pages on Russian social network, and media reports quoted investigators alleging he was linked to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria group.
Putin has said that between 5,000 and 7,000 people from Russia and other former Soviet republics were fighting alongside ISIS and other militants in Syria. He has named the ISIS threat as one of the reasons behind Russia's military campaign in Syria.

Chinara Esengul, an expert on radical Islam based in Kyrgyzstan, said on Dozhd TV that about 850 people from Kyrgyzstan have joined the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, according to official figures.
Russian security agencies have been checking Dzhalilov's contacts in St. Petersburg, while Kyrgyz law enforcement agencies have been talking to his parents in the impoverished nation.
The Russian business daily Kommersant said that security agencies had learned of a terror plot in St. Petersburg from a Russian man affiliated with ISIS who had come from Syria. However, the man knew little and they tried to learn more by tapping phones of his contacts, the newspaper said.
When Dzhalilov blew himself up, 10 other passengers were killed instantly. Three others died shortly after.

Monday's explosion occurred as the train travelled between stations on one of the city's north-south lines. Train driver Alexander Kaverin, 50, continued to the next station after hearing the blast, a decision that aided evacuation efforts and helped save many lives.
""I had no time to think about fear at that moment,"" said Kaverin, who has worked on the subway for 14 years.
The driver appeared in front of reporters on Tuesday looking tired but not visibly shaken by the events of the previous day.

Viktor Khasiyev said he got a call from his father who was in the car hit by the explosion: ""I heard screams, and then he said: 'Son, we got blown up. Please come.""'
Khasiyev rushed across St. Petersburg to find his father covered in blood and soot. ""When he saw me, he cried,"" the son recalled, adding that his father is being treated for a concussion and burns, but that his life isn't in danger.
""I still can't believe that it happened in our city,"" the younger Khasiyev said.
While Moscow and many other Russian cities have seen numerous attacks linked to Islamic militants, the city of imperial palaces and world-famous art museums had largely escaped such violence until Monday.
The entire subway was shut down and evacuated, paralyzing traffic in the city of 5 million before partial service resumed six hours later. Typically crowded during rush hour, the subway on Tuesday morning looked almost deserted as many residents opted for buses.
""First, I was really scared,"" said Viktoria Prishchepova, who did eventually opt to ride the subway. ""I didn't want to go anywhere on the Metro because I was nervous. Everyone was calling their loved ones yesterday, checking if they were OK and how everyone was going to get home.""
On Tuesday morning, 53-year-old Oleg Alexeyev, who trains bomb-detecting police dogs, went to the station where the stricken train pulled in and victims were taken off. He laid flowers there in memory of those who died.
""I travelled on the same route this morning just to see how it felt and think about life. You begin to feel the thin line about life and death,"" he said.





Residents have been bringing flowers to the stations near where the blast occurred. Every corner and window-sill at the ornate, Soviet-built Sennaya Square station on Tuesday was covered with red and white carnations.




Russian authorities have rejected calls to impose visas on Central Asian nationals, hinting that having millions of jobless men across the border from Russia would be a bigger security threat.
Patriach Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, led a service at Moscow's main cathedral on Tuesday for those killed in the blast.
""This terrorist act is a threat to all of us, all our nation,"" he said quoted by the Interfax news agency.
In the past two decades, Russian trains and planes have been frequent targets of attack, usually blamed on Islamic militants. The last confirmed attack was in October 2015 when Islamic State militants downed a Russian airliner heading from an Egyptian resort to St. Petersburg, killing all 224 people on board.
Separately, in the southern Russian city of Astrakhan, two policemen were killed in the early hours on Tuesday in a suspected Islamic militant attack.

ed10126c798d44baee1963700b3718f75cd7eb51,The Associated Press,2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,Trump: U.S. will only fund shovel-ready infrastructure projects,"With legislation overhauling taxes and health care on an uncertain path, U.S. president Donald Trump returned to the familiar. Trump brought 52 business leaders from New York City to the White House Tuesday to talk about another favourite campaign issue — infrastructure and economic growth.
The U.S. economy has so far proven to be a point of pride for a presidency that has otherwise gotten off to a rocky start. Trump inherited a stable economy from former President Barack Obama, an economic recovery that's heading toward its eighth year. But Trump believes he can do more for business.


Trump and several of his top aides emphasized plans to cut red tape and jumpstart infrastructure projects at Tuesday's meeting, while also previewing for the CEOs other priorities that include shortening flight times for airplanes, increasing the power grid's efficiency and targeting programs to improve job training.
At one point the president had an aide come on stage to hold up a long scroll of the government's approval process for building a highway. The president then pledged to eliminate more than 90 per cent of the regulations involved and ""still have safety."" He provided no details.

The administration has committed to directing as much as $1 trillion for infrastructure over the next decade, although it has yet to release policy specifics. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao recently said she expects a plan will be unveiled later this year.
But getting a measure through Congress could be difficult given the Republican majority in both chambers and their desire to reduce tax rates as much as possible. An infrastructure plan that relies on direct funding could possibly raise the budget deficit more than one that uses tax credits.
Trump touted the plan he says is in the works, telling the room, ""We're talking about a very major infrastructure bill of a trillion dollars, perhaps even more.""
Administration officials stressed that it can take more than eight years between funding and the start of project construction, a timeline White House officials say is too slow given the commitment of hundreds of billions of dollars a year.

Trump wanted the CEOs gathered at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building — many of them involved in real estate — to start building roadways, airports, railways, bridges and other infrastructure as quickly as possible.
""If you have a job that you can't start within 90 days, we're not going to give you money for it,"" Trump said.
The president followed up his remarks at the town hall by giving an afternoon speech to the Building Trades Union, pledging to ""rebuild our nation.""

At the CEO town hall, Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, noted that infrastructure upgrades could help growth.
A new air traffic control system that relied on GPS instead of radar would shorten flights and save on jet fuel, helping consumers, he said. Cohn also suggested updates to the power grid to avoid the loss of 20 per cent of electricity in transmission. Trump's daughter Ivanka spoke to the CEOs about the value of job training.
The sales pitch with its technocratic angle seemed perfectly targeted for the assembled business leaders.
""It's terrific in terms of the stuff you're trying to do to modernize the government, educate and so forth,"" said Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of the Blackstone Group, an investment firm, and chairman of the president's policy forum.
""The outside world doesn't always get the message that that's really what is going on,"" he said.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-business-leaders-meeting-april-1.4054536?cmp=rss

The Topeka, Kan.-based retailer said Tuesday it will immediately close nearly 400 stores as part of the reorganization. It has over 4,400 stores in more than 30 countries, including Canada, and was founded in 1956.
Payless plans to reduce its debt by almost 50 per cent, lower how much it pays in interest and line up funds. The company says some of its lenders have agreed make available up to $385 million to keep the stores running.
""This is a difficult, but necessary, decision driven by the continued challenges of the retail environment, which will only intensify,"" said Payless CEO Paul Jones in a statement.



Shoppers are increasingly shifting their buying online or going to discount stores like T.J. Maxx to grab deals on designer brands. That shift has hurt traditional retailers, even low-price outlets like Payless.
In fact, Moody's Investors Service said this year that the number of ""distressed"" retailers — those with cash problems and lots of debt that are facing strong competition — is at the highest rate since 2009. It named Payless as one of those.

The survivors of the deadly flood that washed through this city in southern Colombia were getting ready on Monday to bury their loved ones after authorities began to release the remains recovered from a disaster that has shaken the country.
Colombian authorities said 286 people were killed when rivers surrounding Mocoa overflowed and sent a wall of water and debris surging through the city over the weekend. The death toll was expected to rise since many more were missing and bodies are still being found.

Danilo Garzon Garcia, a 22-year-old resident of the city, had spent the previous day searching with other family members for his young sister. They finally found her body at the local hospital, able to recognize her battered remains because of her underwear.
""It is better this way, better to know,"" Garzon said as he walked alongside the car carrying her body to the cemetery. ""At least we know where she is.""

The Colombian Red Cross says it has received 374 requests for help from families unable to locate loved ones, people whose whereabouts were still unknown three days after the disaster. President Manuel Santos, making his third visit to the remote city in as many days, said 90 per cent of the dead had now been identified and that they would not consider anyone ""disappeared"" until they have established the death toll to the extent possible.
Much of Mocoa was still strewn with rocks, tree limbs, and brown muck. Search and rescue teams continued to probe debris piles when someone heard a possible sound of movement. Many in this city of around 40,000 still seemed in shock from the flood, which poured through the town after a punishing rainfall as people slept late Friday night and early Saturday.
""We do not like to create false expectations but where there is a possibility of life we will do everything possible,"" said Carlos Ivan Marquez, director of Colombia's National Unit of Disaster and Risk Management.

Many victims were young like Garzon's 14-year-old sister. ""She had gone to sleep at a friend's house. When we got to where the house was we didn't find anyone,"" he said.
As he walked calmly in the funeral procession, his mother sobbed and screamed in grief: ""Leidy! Why did you leave me? Leidy, my girl."" Her son then put his arm around her as they made their way to the cemetery.



Santos and other officials pledged both emergency relief and that Mocoa would be rebuilt, including a new water system to replace the one damaged in the flood and new homes for those in the 17 neighbourhoods hit hardest by the surging water. He said he had spoken by phone with U.S. President Donald Trump, who promised assistance as have other nations including China and Venezuela.
Santos also declared an ""economic, social and ecological emergency,"" a designation intended to speed reconstruction efforts.
""We are not going to stop until everyone affected by this natural disaster receives help,"" Marquez said.
Even in a country where heavy rains, a mountainous landscape and informal construction combine to make landslides a common occurrence, the scale of the Mocoa disaster was daunting compared with recent tragedies, including a 2015 landslide that killed nearly 100 people.
Colombia's deadliest landslide, the 1985 Armero disaster, killed more than 20,000 people.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/colombia-flooding-monday-1.4054173?cmp=rss

Most were infected through travel to a region where the virus was actively spreading.<br />  <br /> Of the 1,000, 51 or about 5 per cent had babies or a fetus with one or more Zika-related birth defect. Because of limitations of testing, only tests done within the first few weeks of Zika can test specifically for the Zika virus.<br />  <br /> The team also analyzed 250 women with definitive test results for Zika. Among these, about one in 10 had a fetus or baby with birth defects. The risk was even higher among women infected in the first trimester of pregnancy, where 15 per cent of pregnancies resulted in a fetus or baby with birth defects.<br />  <br /> The study also showed that three out of four babies exposed to Zika had not received brain imaging after birth to diagnose birth defects.<br />  <br /> ""We know that some babies have underlying brain defects that are otherwise not evident at birth.

By halting assistance to the UN Population Fund, the Trump administration is following through on promises to let socially conservative policies that President Donald Trump embraced in his campaign determine the way the U.S. government operates and conducts itself in the world. Though focused on forced abortion — a concept opposed by liberals and conservatives alike — the move to invoke the ""Kemp-Kasten amendment"" was sure to be perceived as a gesture to anti-abortion advocates and other conservative interests.
The UN fund will lose $32.5 million US in funding from the 2017 budget, the State Department said, with funds shifted to similar programs at the U.S. Agency for International Development. It wasn't immediately clear whether the UN fund would also lose out on tens of millions of additional dollars it has typically received from the U.S. in ""non-core"" funds.
Under a three-decade-old law, the U.S. is barred from funding organizations that aid or participate in forced abortion of involuntary sterilization. It's up to each administration to determine which organizations meet that condition. The UN Population Fund has typically been cut off during Republican administrations and had its funding resumed when Democrats control the White House.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee was notified of the move by the State Department in a letter received Monday. The letter followed a formal designation by Tom Shannon, the State Department's undersecretary of political affairs, that said the fund ""supports, or participates in the management of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.""
In a lengthy memorandum obtained by The Associated Press, the State Department said the UN fund partners with China's National Health and Family Planning Commission, responsible for overseeing China's ""two-child policy"" — a loosened version of the notorious ""one-child policy"" in place from 1979 to 2015. It said the UN collaborates with the Chinese agency on family planning. Still, the memo acknowledged there was no evidence of UN support for forced abortions or sterilization in China.
The UN Population Fund, known as UNFPA, said it regretted the U.S. move and argued it was ""erroneous"" to suggest it was complicit in China's policies.
""UNFPA refutes this claim, as all of its work promotes the human rights of individuals and couples to make their own decisions, free of coercion or discrimination,"" the agency said in a statement.

The designation was the latest move by the Trump administration to prioritize traditionally conservative issues in the federal budget. The Trump administration has vowed to cut all dollars for climate change programming, and also restored the so-called global gag rule, which prohibits funding to non-governmental groups that support even voluntary abortions.
The Trump administration has also signalled that it no longer sees a need for the U.S. to so generously fund UN and other international organizations. The White House has proposed cutting roughly one-third from the State Department's budget, with much of it expected to come from foreign aid and global organization dollars, although Congress is expected to restore at least some of that funding
The UN agency's mission involves promoting universal access to family planning and reproductive health, with a goal of reducing maternal deaths and practices like female genital mutilation. The cut-off funds will be ""reprogrammed"" to USAID's Global Health Programs account to focus on similar issues, said a State Department official, who wasn't authorized to comment by name and requested anonymity.
The Kemp-Kasten amendment, enacted in 1985, led to some of the UN agency's funding being initially cut off, then restored by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1993, USAID said in a report. Republican George W. Bush's administration reversed the decision in 2002, but President Barack Obama — a Democrat — gave the funding back after taking office.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/trump-united-nations-population-fund-1.4054113?cmp=rss

Is her collection doomed?,"Ivanka supporters have complained that it's unfair for people to boycott her line simply because they don't like her father's politics.

But Grab Your Wallet supporters claim she's complicit in the president's policies, especially now that she has secured an official, unpaid position in the White House.

""She's clearly part of what I consider to be the problem,"" said boycotter Amanda Dexter, who lives in Wakefield, Que.



Although some retailers are backing away from Ivanka Trump merchandise, it's still up for debate whether or not the link to her father's administration is helping or hurting sales.

Ivanka built her brand by targeting young, professional working women, says marketing expert, Joanne McNeish. But these people tend not to be Trump supporters.

""When you change your brand values and they're no longer consistent with your current target audience, your current target audience tends to leave you,"" says the Ryerson University professor.


However, Ivanka's company recently  that sales have been soaring since the beginning of February.
Lyst, a London-based e-commerce website, has also reported a spike in Ivanka Trump sales in both February and March.


Certainly, some Trump supporters may be making a point of buying her products because of the boycott.

""Just emailed goodbye letter to Bed Bath Beyond,"" announced one supporter on the Ivanka Trump company . ""Need to know WHERE to shop to support her.""



Ivanka Trump may also be experiencing a bump in sales due to the free publicity her brand is getting, thanks to her heightened profile.

She has taken a leave of absence from her company while working in the White House. But she still profits from sales and still wears her line.

Last week, the U.K. Daily Mail posted photos of her dressed ""head-to-toe"" in a floral dress, handbag and shoes from her collection. Ivanka ""looked ready for spring"" stated an  listing retail prices for her ensemble.
Also, members of the administration have  for the brand, including the president, who chastised Nordstrom for cutting back sales.






But the free publicity could lead to trouble for Ivanka's company down the road, because it has sparked conflict-of-interest allegations.

Last month, a proposed  was filed on behalf of women's clothing retailers throughout California. It accuses the company of unfairly benefiting from Ivanka's ties to the White House.
""Defendants continue to fail to take appropriate steps to avoid exploiting public office for private gain,"" alleges the statement of claim.

Now that Ivanka has taken an official job in the White House, cries of conflict of interest may grow louder.

The lawsuit was filed on Monday in Tacoma, Washington, federal court by three EpiPen purchasers. It claims Mylan engaged in a scheme with pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs — companies that act as intermediaries between pharmacies, insurers, and drug companies — to dominate the market and overcharge consumers.

Although other lawsuits have been filed over EpiPen pricing, Monday's is the first to focus on the role of PBMs and to bring claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a federal law historically used against organized crime.
Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin declined to comment.

The EpiPen, acquired by Mylan in 2007, is a hand-held device that treats life-threatening allergic reactions by automatically injecting a dose of epinephrine. The company now sells a .
The plaintiffs in Monday's lawsuit say Mylan paid large rebates to PBMs so they would favor EpiPen over competitors. In helping Mylan control 95 per cent of the epinephrine auto-injector market, the rebates artificially inflated EpiPen's sticker price, resulting in higher costs for many patients, the suit said.

The lawsuit says the three largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers — CVS Caremark, part of CVS Health; Express Scripts Holding Co and OptumRX, part of UnitedHealth Group Inc — aided Mylan's alleged scheme. They were not named as defendants.
The plaintiffs are seeking damages to represent a nationwide class of EpiPen purchasers. Mylan has grappled with a growing backlash from U.S. consumers over the price of EpiPen in the last year. Other class action lawsuits have been filed against Mylan over the pricing of EpiPen, including two currently consolidated in Kansas federal court. However, they have not focused on the role of PBMs.

The company is also under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and said last September that it had agreed to a  with the U.S. Justice Department over how the drug was classified for government buyers. The Justice Department has not confirmed the settlement.

Mylan Chief Executive Officer Heather Bresch has said that the company makes only about $100 per EpiPen pack, and that most consumers pay less than $50 for a two-pack.
The plaintiffs in Monday's lawsuit said Bresch falsely tried to paint Mylan as a ""victim"" of a flawed healthcare system and avoid its own responsibility in setting rebates.

""I'm going,"" the Washington Capitals superstar said when asked his reaction to Monday's  that the National Hockey League would not shut down its regular season for three weeks to allow its players to attend the Winter Olympics in South Korea.

On a day when the Capitals can clinch the Metropolitan Division crown as well as the Presidents' Trophy, Ovechkin faced a horde of media in Toronto following the morning skate ahead of Washington's game against the Maple Leafs.
Everyone wanted to know how he felt about the league's controversial decision. Ovechkin has been outspoken about his desire to represent Russia in the Olympics.
""I didn't change my mind and I won't,"" Ovechkin said. ""I think the situation was the same before Sochi [in 2014]. They try to do some deals ... I'm pretty sure everything is going to be fine. They just want some big story about it.""
Ovechkin believes there is still time for NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and the league's owners to get a better deal from the International Olympic Committee.
""There's still a long time to make a decision and they can say whatever,"" Ovechkin said. ""Next year's schedule is not out there yet… and you can see they don't bluff, but still there's a long time and everything can change. But in my mind, like I said, I'm going, it doesn't matter.""
Capitals owner Ted Leonsis has said he would support Ovechkin's desire to play in the Olympics, something the player greatly appreciates.
""Our owner understands my view, [fellow Russian Evgeny] Kuznetsov's view, [Sweden's Nicklas] Backstrom's view, [Marcus] Johannson's view and the same with [Canadian goalie Braden] Holtby,"" Ovechkin said. ""Everybody wants to be there. For me it's just a situation where you have to take some time and in the future it's going to be fine. I remember before, I think before Sochi it was the same situation because it was in Russia and all kinds of stuff, politics.
""Everything was fine and everybody was happy to be in the Olympic Games.""



Chicago Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews knows all about the Olympic experience, having been to two previous Games, but said he would respect the decision of his owners and employers if the NHL continues to say no to participating.
Even so, he disagreed with the ""short-sightedness"" of the league's decision.




James van Riemsdyk of the Toronto Maple Leafs agreed there is still time for NHL owners to change their minds and allow players to attend the Games.
""There's still a lot of time,"" the American said. ""Obviously when an official announcement is made there has to be some weight put into that, and at this point it doesn't look like we'll go, but we'll see what happens.""

A number of NHL stars, including Montreal Canadiens goaltender Carey Price and Ottawa Senators captain Erik Karlsson, have spoken out against the NHL's decision to skip the Olympic Games. If push comes to shove, van Riemsdyk wonders if others will follow Ovechkin's lead and bolt their NHL teams to play in the Olympics.
""It's hard to say,"" van Riemsdyk said. ""Obviously guys are passionate about wanting to be there so I guess we'll cross that bridge when we get there. Guys love representing their country on [the Olympic] stage and it is a bitter pill to swallow for sure. As players we have shown we want to be there and made that very clear, but this decision was made outside of us.""
""I'm sure some people will,"" Toronto defenceman Jake Gardiner added. ""I know it means a lot to a lot of players. It is one of those things that you obviously don't get too many chances to do so it is pretty cool.""
Van Riemsdyk said the NHL is missing an opportunity to try to grow a sport that most believe ranks last among the four major professional sports leagues in North America in terms of fan interest.
""Just for the sport in general, it's a shame that the best players won't be there,"" van Riemsdyk said. ""I really enjoyed my experience going to the Olympics. Obviously we fell short of our goal, but just the whole aura of being an Olympian and being there with the other athletes and playing on that stage was pretty cool.""
Asked if being an Olympian was one of his goals growing up, Leafs rookie Auston Matthews, who would almost certainly have been included on the U.S. team, said, ""Of course, but that is not where my head is at now,"" adding his focus is on Tuesday's game against the Capitals.
Toronto coach Mike Babcock coached Canada to Olympic gold in 2010 in Vancouver and 2014 in Sochi, but didn't offer much regarding the NHL's decision to skip the games in South Korea.
""I'm disappointed,"" Babcock said. ""I've been twice… greatest event you'll ever go to in your life.""",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/alex-ovechkin-says-he-will-play-at-olympics-1.4054823?cmp=rss

The governing body said Tuesday its Board of Governors had reviewed moves to repeal the ""bathroom bill"" and replace it with a compromise law. The NCAA offered a lukewarm endorsement, saying the new law ""meets the minimal NCAA requirements"" while expressing concerns about its provisions.
The NCAA statement said a majority of the board ""reluctantly voted"" to allow for consideration of bids from North Carolina during current deliberations for sites running through 2022. Events for the 2017-18 season that have already been awarded to the state — such as opening-weekend men's basketball tournament games in Charlotte — will remain in place.
""We are actively determining site selections, and this new law has minimally achieved a situation where we believe NCAA championships may be conducted in a nondiscriminatory environment,"" the statement said. ""If we find that our expectations of a discrimination-free environment are not met, we will not hesitate to take necessary action at any time.""
The North Carolina Sports Association had estimated more than $250 million in potential economic impact from 130 event bids submitted to the NCAA.
The NCAA pulled seven events from the state in September for the 2016-17 season, including men's basketball tournament games from Greensboro in March, in response to the law. Those games were moved to Greenville, South Carolina, which had been banned from hosting events for years before that was lifted following the removal of a Confederate flag from state capitol grounds in 2015.
The NCAA's North Carolina ban didn't affect teams that earn home-court advantage during the course of the season, such as the Duke women's team hosting NCAA tourney games in March.
The NCAA had made it clear that more events already awarded to the state could be relocated, while also saying it would remove North Carolina bids from consideration as it prepared to announce is next wave of site announcements.
But Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper signed the compromise bill Thursday to repeal elements of the law after passage by the state legislature earlier in the day even while saying it wasn't a perfect solution. That came days after the NCAA said the state was down to its final days to get something done.
Cooper, who signed the replacement bill last week, said it was clear that the NCAA had wanted a complete repeal of House Bill 2, as did he. But Cooper has said the new law was the best compromise he could get given the Republicans' veto-proof majorities in the legislature.
""We are glad that the NCAA is going to come back to North Carolina and join us in fighting for more protections and for more ways to keep people from being discriminated against,"" Cooper told reporters Tuesday.

Asked about the NCAA's lukewarm statement, Cooper said NCAA leaders still ""recognized the progress in this legislation and they recognized that even though it wasn't everything they wanted, that it was enough for them to come back and to join us in the fight to help to continue to improve our laws so people can be protected from discrimination.""
Republican House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger said in a statement they are ""pleased with the NCAA's decision and acknowledgment that our compromise legislation `restores the state to . a landscape similar to other jurisdictions presently hosting NCAA championships.""'
The NCAA move drew immediate criticism from LGBT rights groups Human Rights Campaign and Equality NC, with HRC president Chad Griffin saying the NCAA ""simply let North Carolina lawmakers off the hook.""
""It is disappointing to see the NCAA backpedal after it stood strong against the deeply discriminatory HB2,"" Equality NC executive director Chris Sgro said in a statement. ""HB142 continues the same discriminatory scheme put forward by HB2 and does little to protect the NCAA's players, employees, and fans. The NCAA's decision has put a seal of approval on state-sanctioned discrimination.""
The Atlantic Coast Conference had followed the NCAA's lead last fall, pulling 10 neutral-site events from the state, including moving the football championship game from Charlotte to Orlando, Florida.
But the ACC said Friday its Council of Presidents had voted to again consider North Carolina sites to host events. And that also ensured events already set for the state for the 2017-18 season would remain in place, meaning the football title game would return in December to Charlotte since it was contractually set to run there through 2019.
Speaking at the Final Four on Thursday, NCAA President Mark Emmert said the governing body would review the changes in hopes of reaching a quick decision by early this week.
""I'm personally very pleased that they have a bill to debate and discuss,"" Emmert said then. ""The politics of this in North Carolina are obviously very, very difficult. But they have passed a bill now and it'll be a great opportunity for our board to sit and debate and discuss it.""",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/north-carolina-ncaa-law-change-1.4054572?cmp=rss

Now they want others to see how a warming planet is melting masses of ice in a series of before and after photos.
In the Geological Society of America's GSA Today journal, a group of ice researchers and a photographer-filmmaker published pictures showing how several of the world's glaciers have thinned.

""There is something fundamentally compelling about the approach they take. For all our emphasis on models and math, seeing is still believing,"" said University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos, who wasn't part of the team.
Under natural conditions, glaciers melt and retreat at times while others grow and advance. But measurements from Earth's 5,200 glaciers show warming temperatures have increased the number of melting glaciers and the speed of glacial retreat, according to the study. Scientists primarily blame man-made global warming from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.
""There is something that touches the heart more profoundly when you see it in pictures than when you see it in maps or reports or graphs,"" said photographer James Balog, who founded the non-profit Earth Vision Institute. ""It certainly brings it alive.""

cf0caa65837b8e0fe4b90da47f3f5ffadca4e3cc,The Associated Press,2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,"Roger Ailes, Fox News hit with new allegation of sexual harassment","Fox News contributor came forward to level more sexual-harassment allegations against deposed chief executive Roger Ailes on Monday, two days after it was revealed the network's most popular on-air personality, Bill O'Reilly, has settled multiple complaints about his own behaviour with women.
O'Reilly returned to the air on Monday following a weekend report in The New York Times that he and his employer had paid five women $13 million US to settle allegations of sexual harassment or other inappropriate conduct by Fox's ratings king. He made no mention of the case on his show.
Meanwhile, the lawyer for another woman who says she was punished for rebuffing O'Reilly's advances called on New York City's Human Rights Commission to investigate O'Reilly's behaviour.
The new lawsuit against Ailes was brought by Fox's Julie Roginsky and is notable because it accuses Fox's current management of trying to cover up for Ailes.
Roginsky said Ailes, who lost his job last summer following sexual-harassment complaints he has denied, suggested she have sex with ""older, married, conservative men."" She said Ailes would insist upon a kiss hello at their meetings, requiring her to bend over so he could look down her dress.
She was seeking a permanent role on Fox's show . But after an April 2015 meeting at which she turned down Ailes' advances, he wouldn't meet with her again, and she never got the regular role, she said.
Later, she said, she was pressured to join the so-called Team Roger, a group of people who publicly defended Ailes when the first harassment complaint made public against the Fox boss was brought by Gretchen Carlson last summer. Roginsky refused.
She said that even though Fox executives knew she had her own harassment allegations against Ailes, she was never encouraged to speak to the law firm hired by Fox News parent 21st Century Fox to investigate claims against him. And she said Fox never looked into her charges. Her lawyer would not say Monday why Roginsky never contacted the firm on her own.

Roginsky said that during a meeting in December, new Fox top executive Bill Shine told her he didn't believe the allegations against Ailes until recently. But the lawsuit alleges Shine and other top Fox executives should have known about Ailes's behaviour much earlier.
""Shine and other senior executives kept Ailes's conduct secret and enabled it,"" said the lawsuit, filed in state court.
Fox News representatives did not immediately return messages for comment. But Fox's new human resources chief sent a memo to staff late Monday, saying that ""in light of some of the accounts published over the last few days,"" he wanted to make clear the various avenues network employees could take if they had concerns about behaviour in the workplace.

Roginsky said she believes Shine hasn't given her an opportunity for advancement in retaliation for her harassment complaint and her refusal to speak out against Carlson.
At a Los Angeles news conference Monday, lawyer Lisa Bloom detailed allegations against O'Reilly by Wendy Walsh, a regular guest on the prime-time show .
Bloom said O'Reilly had told Walsh he would recommend her for a paid contributor role on the network. Walsh and O'Reilly had dinner in Los Angeles in 2013, but when Walsh refused his invitation to go to his hotel room, his attitude changed and she was soon dropped from the show, according to Walsh.
Bloom was seeking an investigation by the city Human Rights Commission. A spokesman for the commission said no claim had been filed. Claims have to address activity that happened within the city's five boroughs and must be filed within one year of an alleged infraction.
Walsh said she came forward because she was told by a Times reporter that many of the women who have accused O'Reilly of harassment are bound by gag orders. She said she is not bound by any such agreement, and the statute of limitations for suing has run out.

""Nobody can silence me because my voice is not for sale,"" Walsh said. ""Nobody can buy my voice.""
O'Reilly said over the weekend he is vulnerable to lawsuits from people who threaten to cause him bad publicity unless they get paid. He said he had ""put to rest any controversies"" to spare his children.
O'Reilly's ratings have gone up over the past year with the intense interest in politics. Independent studies show he generates more than $100 million in advertising revenue per year for TV's top-rated cable news network. But at least one advertiser, car company Mercedes-Benz, said it was pulling its ads from the show because of the ""disturbing"" allegations.
Hyundai said it had ads planned to run during O'Reilly's hour but are reallocating them ""due to the recent and disturbing allegations.""",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/fox-news-sexual-harassment-claims-1.4054158?cmp=rss

Superior Court Judge Scott M. Gordon refused to address how Polanski would be sentenced if he returned to the U.S. after 40 years abroad. He noted that other courts, including a California appellate court, have ruled that the Oscar winner is a fugitive and must return to Los Angeles for sentencing.
""There is no sufficient or compelling basis for reconsideration of these issues,"" Gordon wrote.
Polanski was charged with six felonies in 1977 after he was accused of plying a 13-year-old girl with champagne and part of a sedative pill, then raping her at actor Jack Nicholson's house.
Polanski pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor, but he fled Los Angeles on the eve of sentencing in 1978. He has sought to resolve the case several times without personally appearing in court.
His travel has since been confined to three countries: his native France, Switzerland and Poland, where he fled the Holocaust.

The victim has said she forgives the director and believes the case should end.
Polanski, 83, has long contended that he is the victim of judicial misconduct because a now-deceased judge who handled the case suggested in private remarks that he would renege on a plea bargain and sentencing agreement. It called for no more time behind bars for the director after he spent 42 days in a prison undergoing a diagnostic screening.
Polanski's lawyer, Harland Braun, said Gordon's order failed to address what he called the central issue in the case — misconduct by several previous judges who handled the case.

Polanski contends emails show that several judges had discussed how Polanski had to return to Los Angeles for sentencing.
""It seems like this just another coverup,"" Braun said in an interview.
He said his efforts were aimed at seeing if the judicial system could fix previous errors in the case, and whether it was ""capable of healing itself.""
""In that regard, Judge Gordon proved that he cannot,"" Braun said.
Gordon's ruling says Polanski and Braun had ""not presented sufficient credible, admissible evidence or legal arguments to warrant the requested relief.""
Previous rulings have stated that the only way Polanski can address his allegations is to return to Los Angeles for his sentencing hearing. That would likely involve him being arrested and serving additional time behind bars while he awaited a hearing.
Braun has said Polanski's confinement in jail and house arrest in Switzerland during a failed extradition effort in 2009 and 2010 meant the director has already served his sentence.
The ruling came two weeks after Gordon convened a hearing to address several requests by Polanski's lawyer. Los Angeles prosecutors, who declined to comment on Monday's ruling, vehemently opposed any ruling that would end the case without Polanski's appearance in court.
Deputy District Attorney Michele Hanisee said Polanski was asking Gordon to give a ""wealthy celebrity different treatment than any other fugitive.""
Polanski won an Academy Award for best director for his 2002 film and was nominated for 1974'sand 1979's.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/polanski-offer-rejected-la-court-1.4054085?cmp=rss
9fc256329f78ec0a34dd6625ed55fc418278c801,Reuters,2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,Democrats have votes to block Gorsuch temporarily from U.S. Supreme Court,"Democrats on Monday amassed enough support to block a U.S. Senate confirmation vote on U.S. President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, but Republicans vowed to change the Senate rules to ensure the conservative judge gets the lifetime job.
The Senate judiciary committee voted 11-9 along party lines to send Gorsuch's nomination to the full Senate, setting up a political showdown between Trump's fellow Republicans and the opposition Democrats that appears likely to trigger a change in long-standing Senate rules to allow his confirmation.
Before the vote, Senator Christopher Coons became the 41st Democrat to announce support for a procedural hurdle called a filibuster requiring a super-majority of 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate to allow a confirmation vote.

Coons said that he had decided to oppose the president's nominee over concerns that include his vague answers in his hearing.

Coons's opposition will prevent Republicans from reaching the 60 votes they need to move Gorsuch over procedural hurdles to a final Senate vote.


Determined to confirm him despite Democratic objections, Republicans will likely change Senate rules later this week to reduce the threshold from 60 to a simple majority.
Republican Senate leaders insist Gorsuch will be confirmed on the Senate floor on Friday regardless of what the Democrats do, even if they have to change long-standing Senate rules.
Coons told fellow members of the judiciary committee it would be ""tragic"" if Republicans change Senate rules to end the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. ""The principles that have defined the Senate are crumbling, and we are poised to hasten that this week,"" Coons said.
Democratic senators Dianne Feinstein, the committee's top Democrat, and Mark Warner, not a member of the panel, also announced opposition to Gorsuch on Monday and support for a filibuster.
If the Democrats mount a successful filibuster, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would be expected to force a confirmation vote by having the Senate change its rules and allow for a simple majority vote for confirmation of Supreme Court justices, a move sometimes called the ""nuclear option"" that Trump has urged.
Senate confirmation of Gorsuch, 49, would restore the nine-seat high court's conservative majority, fulfilling one of Trump's top campaign promises. Trump in January nominated Gorsuch, a conservative appeals court judge from Colorado, to the lifetime job as a justice.
Gorsuch was nominated to fill a vacancy created by the February 2016 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.

Democratic Senator Michael Bennet, who represents Gorsuch's home state of Colorado and introduced the nominee during his confirmation hearing, said he would oppose the filibuster effort but did not take a position on whether to vote in favor of the judge.
The committee's chairman, Republican Chuck Grassley, defended Gorsuch as a mainstream jurist worthy of confirmation despite the complaints of many Democrats, and that ""there isn't a whole lot of mystery"" that the panel will approve the nomination.
Feinstein said this was not a ""routine nomination,"" noting that the Republican-led Senate last year flatly refused to consider Democratic former president Barack Obama's nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland to fill the same high court vacancy.
""There was simply no reason that the nomination of Judge Garland could not proceed, other than to deny the then-president of the United States, President Barack Obama, the ability to fill the seat,"" Feinstein said.

Feinstein criticized Gorsuch's rulings in cases involving a fired truck driver and an autistic child and faulted his actions as a lawyer in Republican former President George W. Bush's Justice Department regarding detainee interrogation techniques critics called torture.
Feinstein also said she was disturbed by the millions of dollars of ""dark money"" from anonymous donors backing advertising and political advocacy by conservative groups to help Gorsuch win confirmation.
In addition to Gorsuch, the judiciary committee will be considering two other nominations — Rod Rosenstein to be deputy attorney general and Rachel Brand to be associate attorney general. If confirmed, they will be the No. 2 and No. 3 officials at the Justice Department under Attorney General Jeff Sessions.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/gorsuch-senate-judiciary-1.4052410?cmp=rss

Because of several factors, however, it remains unclear when 38-year-old Aydin Coban could be sent to Canada following Tuesday's ruling.
First, his extradition must be approved by the Dutch security and justice minister.
In addition, Coban was convicted last month by a Dutch court and  for online fraud and blackmail of 34 other young women and men.

When asked whether the extradition would come before or after Coban serves his Dutch sentence, prosecution spokesman Wim de Bruin said, ""That has not been decided yet.""
Furthermore, after Coban's conviction last month, his lawyer, Robert Malewicz, said he planned to appeal the verdict, which could mean a new trial. Malewicz did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment today.

In Canada, Coban faces a separate trial in the cyber extortion of Amanda, whose story drew global attention to online abuse.
In October 2012, Amanda, who was 15 at the time, took her life after posting a video on YouTube saying she had been blackmailed by someone online.
The RCMP charged Coban in 2014 in relation to the Todd case. The five charges include possession of child pornography, extortion, internet luring, criminal harassment and distribution of child pornography.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/amanda-todd-aydin-coban-extradition-1.4054283?cmp=rss

But he could not say whether those using the IMSI catchers might be domestic organized crime, a foreign intelligence agency or some other source.

CBC News and Radio-Canada spent months investigating the use of IMSI catchers in and around Parliament Hill in Ottawa. 


The problem with certain IMSI catchers is they can go a bit further, according to cybersecurity expert Daniel Tobok.
""[Some] can actually intercept your voice communication, your data communication. So your voice calls can be recorded, your text messages could be read,"" Tobok said in an interview on CBC News Network's .
""That is one of the problems. Somebody could actually intercept your communication and have access into your personal information on your phone.""
Tobok said some devices can even intercept encrypted communication applications.
""When somebody casts a very large net and intercepts everything that comes through, then they could have time to potentially decrypt the WhatsApps of the world and any other type of encrypted communication. All depends on who you are dealing with,"" he told host Rosemary Barton.
It is unclear what kind of IMSI catcher or catchers are being used in the Ottawa area.


Media in the United States, Norway and Australia have done similar tests, but this is the first time it has been conducted by a media outlet in Canada.
During tests in December and January, the CryptoPhone set off alerts at locations around Parliament Hill, including the nearby Byward Market, the Rideau Centre shopping mall and CBC offices in downtown Ottawa.

Because IMSI catchers have a radius of about half a kilometre in an urban setting, the IMSI catchers CBC detected could reach territory including Parliament Hill, the Prime Minister's Office in Langevin Block, National Defence headquarters, as well as the U.S. and Israeli embassies.
CBC News and Radio-Canada then used even more sophisticated equipment called an Overwatch Sensor that confirmed the presence of an IMSI catcher close to Parliament Hill.
Sweeping sensitive areas and perimeters is definitely something the RCMP and CSIS should be doing, said Tobok.

""As you are getting to what we call sensitive areas in the business, your phones, your potential identity is being harvested just to see if you are on a particular list … Washington is very well known for this. Anywhere around Capitol Hill they usually know your IMI number and who's coming, who's going within a particular radius,"" said Tobok.
Goodale said that like most police and security services around the world, Canadian law enforcement and intelligence agencies use the technology in the course of their work, but only in compliance with the law. 
""Both CSIS and the RCMP have the legal, and privacy, issues that are involved here under active ongoing assessment and reassessment to ensure that in a field where technology is rapidly changing all the time, that our Canadian agencies like CSIS and the RCMP are always staying squarely within the four corners of the law,"" Goodale said.

The gift was a framed picture of a plaque with the still-legible and barely weathered words:
""This cairn was erected on this spot by the Right Honourable Pierre Elliott Trudeau. P.C., M.P., Prime Minister of Canada and his son Justin during their visit to the High Arctic August 1975.""
Justin Trudeau was three years old at the time.
""I remember this trip, we built this cairn,"" recalled Trudeau, standing in his office with Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan. ""It was one of those moments that I'll never forget. It was my first visit to the Arctic.""

The plaque was mentioned in  CBC News obtained under the federal Access To Information Act, which described how a team of defence scientists stumbled upon the plaque last summer.
""Considering the historical importance of this plaque,"" reads the briefing note, ""it would be commemorative for the Minister of National Defence to present these pictures to the Prime Minister of Canada, the Right Honourable Justin Trudeau.""

At the time of the Trudeaus' visit, the High Arctic was taking on increasing significance. Canada's research community was trying to understand the behaviour of Arctic ice after it became clear a few years before that northern waters could be opened to shipping traffic.
The potential commercial interest generated a ""boost of activity,"" said Whitney Lackenbauer, a history professor at the University of Waterloo, who specializes in Arctic sovereignty.
He said the Arctic evolved into a ""space and place in need of protection. There was also a rising awareness of Indigenous rights.""
Successive prime ministers have taken greater interest in issues such as Canada's sovereignty over the Arctic. Former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper made regular trips to the North each summer to observe military exercises.
As part of its goal of improving surveillance in the Arctic, National Defence sent its Radar Sensing and Exploitation Team to Ellesmere Island last July. It was during an exercise on July 10 that a member of the team discovered the cairn bearing the Trudeau plaque on a small island called Ward Hunt Island.

""I was very surprised … that [Ward Hunt Island] was actually further than Alert,"" said Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan.
In fact, the island off Ellesmere Island's northern coast is as far north as you can go in Canada. It's an area Lackenbauer describes as a ""gateway"" for scientists to do their work.

Pierre Trudeau also used the 1975 visit, a private trip that included Justin Trudeau's maternal grandfather, James Sinclair, as an opportunity to do a little diving.
According to a Canadian Press report at the time, the elder Trudeau ""put on a diving suit and explored the bottom of the Arctic Ocean for 35 minutes."" Trudeau, Sinclair told CP, ""did not see any large sea mammals, but got a good look at jellyfish, several types of other fish and a variety of plant life.""
It was the kind of excursion typical of the former prime minister, said his biographer, John English. He ""had a tremendous interest in the North.
""Canoeing and the frontier were part of his makeup. The Arctic was something he was drawn to from an early time.""",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/arctic-cairn-ward-hunt-island-trudeau-1.4055558?cmp=rss

Members of the committee must now decide on an appropriate sanction for Meredith after the Senate ethics officer found him in violation of two sections of Red Chamber's code of conduct, namely that he has brought the Senate into disrepute as a result of his behaviour.
The Conservative chair of the committee, Senator Raynell Andreychuk, said after the meeting: ""Everything is under consideration.""
That would include an outright expulsion, something that has never been done before in Canadian history.

Senate administration went to unprecedented lengths Tuesday to shield Meredith from the media, removing reporters from the entrance closest to the elevators used by senators to access the committee room.
The Parliamentary Protective Service said it received ""special instructions"" to forbid any member of the media from standing near the door or in its vicinity, escorting reporters to an alternative entrance and parking them behind a velvet rope. Meredith later slipped into the room unnoticed.
Later, a man presenting himself as a Senate staffer, told CBC News Meredith would make himself available for a scrum with the media, but then stood in the way as Meredith and his lawyer dashed up a nearby staircase to his fourth floor office, avoiding television cameras.
In a highly unusual move, the PPS also placed one of its officers outside of the senator's office.

According to long-standing rules agreed to by both the Parliamentary Press Gallery and House of Commons and Senate administration, filming and the presence of reporters is explicitly allowed in these areas.
""Filming or photography is permitted at designated areas, outside committee/caucus rooms, cabinet; the Hall of Honour/rotunda, during a committee or caucus meeting or rooms where any other meetings are being held. As well, filming and photography is permitted in the [House of Commons] Foyer,"" the rules state. (The full text of the rules is available .)
The meeting itself was held ""in camera,"" or in private, and media were not permitted in the room as the committee met with Meredith.

Meredith's lawyer, William Trudell, said his client would not speak to the media. When asked if there is a public right to know about the outcome of his client's meeting with the committee, Trudell said it seemed as if the media had already made up its collective mind as to the guilt or innocence of his client.
Meredith, who is still being paid, will not be making any further statements, Trudell said, out of respect for the committee's process.

Trudell said he hoped the committee would give his client the opportunity to appear again. Meredith, a Pentecostal pastor, has said while his relationship with a teenager was a ""moral failing,"" he does not believe he should be forced to resign from the Senate.
Trudell said his client went out of his way to be in Ottawa in person Tuesday, as he has been on sick leave since the ethics officer, Lyse Ricard, first released her report last month. He refused to say what sort of illness the senator is battling, but noted he took breaks during the almost three-hour long meeting.
Independent Senator Andre Pratte, who is not a member of the committee, told reporters Meredith should be expelled from the Senate because his actions don't befit the office of senator.
Senator Anne Cools, also an independent, said Meredith's actions are a private matter and the Senate shouldn't be policing the personal lives of its members, or considering expulsion, because that is a ""slippery slope.""",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/don-meredith-committee-media-access-1.4054791?cmp=rss

The Liberals had raised the ideas for consideration in their 2015 election platform and tasked the special committee on electoral reform with studying the possibilities.
But MPs on the special committee were  and , and recommended against pursuing either. 
In a , submitted on Monday, Minister of Democratic Institutions Karina Gould said the government agrees with the committee.

The Liberals say they are committed to finding other ways of encouraging voter turnout. Legislation currently before Parliament would allow citizens to use the voter information card for identification purposes at the polls and restore Elections Canada's ability to promote voting.
The Liberal response restates that the government won't be pursuing electoral reform, .
""The electoral system is foundational to any democratic system, and any changes to how we vote must have the broad support of Canadians,"" Gould writes. 
""As stated in my mandate letter released publicly on February 1, 2017, 'A clear preference for a new electoral system, let alone a consensus, has not emerged.

The Conservatives saw gains in three of the five ridings while the New Democrats took hits of their own in all but one, leaving the Conservatives as the winners of the night.

The Liberals held on to the three ridings they were defending (Markham–Thornhill, Ottawa–Vanier and Saint-Laurent) while the Conservatives retained their two seats of Calgary Midnapore and Calgary Heritage, the latter being the old seat of former prime minister Stephen Harper.
But across the five ridings, the Liberals' vote share dropped by an average of 4.7 points. That was a steeper loss than the NDP's average 2.2-point decline. The Conservatives gained an average of 4.2 points compared to their support in the 2015 federal election.
This is a reversal of the trends exhibited between the 2011 and 2015 votes, when the Liberals made gains in 13 of 15 byelections and the Conservatives suffered losses in all of them.
Granted, byelections can be largely driven by local issues. But being on the wrong side of the trend line .

Turnout was low on Monday, ranging from 27.5 per cent in Markham–Thornhill to 34.1 per cent in Ottawa–Vanier. Accordingly, the big parties lost votes in every riding — and the Liberals lost vote share across the board.
Though the most significant decline for the Liberals occurred in Ottawa–Vanier, the result for Mona Fortier (51.2 per cent of the vote, down 6.4 points) was better than the late Mauril Bélanger's scores between 2004 and 2011, when the Liberals were either in opposition or reduced to a minority government.

The nomination controversies in Markham–Thornhill and Saint-Laurent did not seem to have a disproportionate impact on Liberal fortunes, as the decreases suffered there by Mary Ng (down 4.4 points to 51.3 per cent) and Emmanuella Lambropoulos (down 2.5 points to 59.1 per cent) were not notably different than those in the other three ridings.
The Liberals were unable to maintain  (when they won their first seats there since 1968), capturing 21.7 per cent of the vote in Calgary Heritage (down 4.3 points) and just 17 per cent in Calgary Midnapore (down 5.7 points). Nevertheless, with the exception of 2015, those were the party's best results in the ridings since 1980 and 1997, respectively.

With 71.5 per cent support for Bob Benzen in Calgary Heritage, up 7.7 points from 2015, and 77.2 per cent for Stephanie Kusie (+10.5) in Calgary Midnapore, the Conservatives made a renewed show of strength in two traditional strongholds. Kusie's score in Calgary Midnapore was the Conservatives' best in the riding since the merger of the Progressive Conservatives and Canadian Alliance in 2003.

The Conservatives also put up good numbers in Markham–Thornhill, the kind of GTA riding the Conservatives will need to win in the future to form a majority government. The party captured 39 per cent of the vote, up 6.7 points and their best performance since 1997 — when the Liberals last lost the riding.
But the Conservatives put up worse results in two francophone ridings, Ottawa–Vanier and Saint-Laurent. The party held its 19.5 per cent vote share in the Montreal seat. In Ottawa–Vanier, the Conservatives were down 3.7 points, their worst performance there since 1968.
It is possible the Conservative leadership race has helped boost the party elsewhere, but the lack of French-language skills among the field of 14 candidates for the top job (including one of the front-runners, Kevin O'Leary) may not be doing the party favours in ridings with large francophone populations.

The New Democrats saw their vote drop most significantly in ridings that were primarily head-to-head contests between the Liberals and the Conservatives — down 4.4 points in Calgary Heritage, 5.2 points in Calgary Midnapore and 7.2 points in Markham–Thornhill.
Their numbers in these three ridings were their worst since before Jack Layton took over the party in 2003.
The loss of 3.7 points in Saint-Laurent is not a good sign for the New Democrats in Quebec, where the party needs to regain some lustre.
But the results in Ottawa–Vanier were far more positive for the NDP. The New Democrats gained 9.4 points, reaching 28.7 per cent and nearly matching their all-time best performance in the riding in 2011.


The Greens saw little change in their numbers with the exception of a gain of 5.6 points in Saint-Laurent, where their deputy leader, Daniel Green, was a candidate. The Bloc Québécois, in its first electoral test under new leader Martine Ouellet, did little better in Saint-Laurent than the party did in 2015, but also no worse.
So the results of the byelections have something to please each of the opposition parties, with the Conservatives having the most to smile about in addition to their two wins.
On the government's side, their three comfortable victories might be little to worry about just yet. But if these byelections acted as a mid-term report card for the Liberals, they might want to return to their studies or risk failing the next test.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-byelections-2017-1.4054337?cmp=rss

The Quebec Mounted Police Members Association filed its bid for certification with the federal labour relations board on Tuesday.
The RCMP won the right to unionize at the Supreme Court of Canada more than two years ago. To date though, members of Canada's national police force have largely been split in their support for two groups seeking to represent them: the National Police Federation and the Mounted Professional Police Association of Canada.
Those two groups do not get along.

The Quebec group, with 800 members, is smaller than the national organizations, but it has the longest history in terms of seeking the right to form a union.
In a news release, Serge Bilodeau, president of the Quebec group, said while he wanted Mounties to file a single request for certification, ""our efforts at joining our union goals across the country were in vain.""
""While the request to unionize RCMP officers is being made solely on behalf of Quebec's members, the move is justifiable due to the specifics that are applicable to the particular needs of Quebec's frontline members,"" said the release.

That news release, which stated Bilodeau's group had submitted its application to Quebec's public services labour relations board, had labour experts and rival associations scratching their heads, because the RCMP is under federal jurisdiction.
Ottawa lawyer Paul Champ pointed out such a move would be contrary to the Public Service Labour Relations Act and the RCMP Act.
However, Tuesday evening, the group said its press release was wrong, and its application had in fact been filed with the federal board.
Brian Sauvé, who's with the National Police Federation, did not welcome the move by the Quebec group to seek certification.
""We do not see the value in having Canada's national police force divided up into smaller bargaining agents. We're all police officers, we all wear the same uniform and the government has indicated it wants a single bargaining agent,"" he told CBC News.

""This incident is not reflective of any views held in our organization,"" Reid said.
""CARAS and our charitable arm MusiCounts conduct significant efforts to engage and support women, particularly funding initiatives for girls in school and community music programs.

Liberal Senator Joan Fraser, a self-described ""ardent feminist,"" said the new phrasing is both grammatically incorrect and a misguided attempt to make the song reflect ""today's values.""
""It's a fine example of what happens when you let politicians meddle,"" she said of Bill C-210 to amend the National Anthem Act. ""Politicians are not usually poets."" 

Bélanger, who  after a battle with ALS, sought to make the anthem gender-neutral by removing the phrase ""all thy sons command"" and replacing it with ""all of us command.""
The bill  in the House of Commons largely along party lines, with all Liberal and NDP MPs voting in favour of the changes, while most Conservatives opposed. Some notable female Tory MPs, including Michelle Rempel and Lisa Raitt, backed Bélanger's bill.
Nearly a year later, the bill is now in its last legislative phase — third reading in the Senate — awaiting a final vote.  As per the Senate's procedural policy, debate on the bill can be continually adjourned by critics, punting a vote on the matter to a later date.

The bill's backers, including Liberal MP Greg Fergus, hope to see the bill passed into law in time for Canada's 150th birthday celebrations on July 1.
While others, including Conservative Nova Scotia Senator Michael MacDonald, have said the ""sloppy"" legislation should be defeated in its present form because it's simply an attempt to sanitize a national symbol.
""If we are constantly revising everything because it was written in another generation, our national symbols will have no value. Our history means nothing in this country anymore, and it's a shame that we're doing this,"" he said in an interview with CBC News. ""The Senate should not be reticent in defending and preserving the heritage of Canada.""

Fraser, a journalist and editor appointed by former prime minister Jean Chrétien in 1998, said it is a dangerous precedent to start fiddling with lyrics written by a man long dead.
""If we are to become engrossed in the idea that we must at all times be correctly modern, we lose a part of our heritage,"" Fraser said in a . ""It may not be a perfect heritage — I'm not suggesting it is — but it is ours. I suggest that it deserves respect and acceptance for what it is: imperfect but our own.""

Fraser said if inclusion is the primary goal, it makes little sense to leave overtly Christian references untouched. Former prime minister Pierre Trudeau's government added the words ""God keep our land glorious and free"" in 1980, she noted, the same year the song officially became the country's national anthem.
""Make no mistake about it, colleagues: we're talking about the Christian god here, not just anyone's god,"" she said.
Since 1980, 12 private member's bills have been introduced in the House to strip the gendered reference to ""sons,"" which some have argued is discriminatory. All attempts have failed.

""It is something that will make our national anthem more inclusive,"" Independent Ontario Senator Frances Lankin said in defence of the bill last month. ""This change might be small, but it may very well have a major impact on how the next generation views our evolving history.""
The song itself has been changed many times since the English version was first penned in 1908 by Robert Stanley Weir, a judge and poet. Indeed, shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, Weir changed the line in question from ""thou dost in us command"" to ""in all thy sons command.""

MacDonald is vehemently opposed to Bélanger's wording because he believes the ""politically correct"" changes were rammed through the House despite little or no public demand for such a modification.
He said the Liberal government used Bélanger, a man who was near death, as a ""vehicle"" for the changes.

""That's not the way to use Parliament. Everybody knows the tragedy of his circumstances, a very tragic thing — but, with respect, it's the government that treated it like the Children's Wish Foundation,"" MacDonald said. 

""This is just change for the sake of change, and just catering to a very narrow group of people who want to impose their agenda on everything,"" he said. ""Leave the anthem alone.""
The Cape Breton senator also takes issue with the bill because it only changes the English-language version of the national anthem, even though the French words would have a hard time getting the ""social justice warrior seal of approval.""
""Why should one official version of the anthem be exempt from re-examination?"" MacDonald said. ""It is, without question, an ethnic French-Canadian, Catholic, nationalist battle hymn, certainly non-inclusive, yet I am not offended. It is just part of Canada's history in song.""
MacDonald said he has consulted with English and linguistic professors about the wording change, and they agree that the bill's authors ""botched"" the language.



""The proper and only acceptable pronoun substitution for the phrase 'All thy sons command' is 'All of our command,'"" MacDonald said. ""This is not opinion. This is fact.""

Money listed in documents tabled in the House of Commons as ""per diems"" for a tour technician who accompanied the prime minister was actually paid to the Aga Khan who owns Bell Island.
""The $1,604 is the total amount paid to the owner of Bell Island for the technician's 12 day stay ($100 US x 12 days),"" wrote Privy Council spokesman Raymond Rivet following questions from CBC News.
The $1,604 was part of the $127,000 that Trudeau's vacation ended up costing the government.


Conservative MP Tony Clement, a former president of the Treasury Board, which oversees expense account policy for the government, said the revelation adds to the unanswered questions and ethical issues swirling around Trudeau's trip.
""To have the costs paid directly to the owner of the island, the Aga Khan, is highly unusual,"" he said. ""In fact, I've never heard of a case of that happening before.""
NDP MP Nathan Cullen said Trudeau's choice to vacation on a billionaire's private island raises questions.
""It stinks, the whole thing stinks,"" said NDP MP Nathan Cullen.
The revelation that the government reimbursed the Aga Khan for at least one government employee's stay on his island highlights the complications inherent in Trudeau's decision to vacation on the Aga Khan's Caribbean island during the Christmas holidays.
For example, government employees are entitled to claim per diems to cover meals and incidentals when they travel on government business. However, they are not entitled to claim meal per diems if meals are provided.
Accepting meals and accommodation from someone who has a foundation that gets government grants and which lobbies government officials raises ethical questions. However, reimbursing the costs means that taxpayer's money went to a friend of Trudeau's family.

Moreover, the money paid by the Privy Council may not be the only money paid to the Aga Khan.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has refused to say how its officers who accompanied Trudeau spent $53,253 on ""travel, accommodation and per diems,"" arguing it could jeopardize the prime minister's security. The RCMP spent another $18,735 on overtime and shift differentials for the officers.
Generally, RCMP officers fly with the prime minister on government planes and accompany him at all times.
Trudeau has come under fire in the House of Commons for taking the trip.
Liberal MP and longtime friend Seamus O'Regan and his husband Steve Doss joined Trudeau's family on the island along with Liberal Party president Anna Gainey and her husband Tom Pitfield, who was a key member of Trudeau's election campaign team.
Trudeau has defended the trip, arguing that the Aga Khan —  leader of the world's Ismaili Muslims — is a longtime family friend. However, that has not stopped Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson from launching an investigation into a complaint filed by Conservative MP Andrew Scheer.
The Aga Khan Foundation Canada has received federal government grants in the past for its international development projects and is currently registered to lobby several government offices, including the prime minister's office.

Any time a prime minister goes anywhere — even on vacation — it costs money.
Security rules call for prime ministers to travel by government plane. Jetting off to the Bahamas and back in an armed forces CC-144 Challenger cost $32,000.
Each trip includes an RCMP protective detail and a Privy Council Office tour technician.
""Irrespective of his schedule or location, the prime minister must always be in a position to carry out official government duties,"" Rivet explained.
""As has been the case for many years and for previous prime ministers, the prime minister is provided with comprehensive technical and tour (audio and visual) support during all travel, domestically and internationally, regardless of whether he or she is on personal or government business. Support for the prime minister includes setting up a temporary secure office that provides a link to the PCO computer environment.""
The technician travelled to Nassau in advance of Trudeau on Dec. 23 and left the Bahamas on Jan. 5 after spending 12 days on Bell Island.

To get the equipment to the Bahamas, Global Affairs used a diplomatic courier. Packages carried by diplomatic courier are not subject to customs inspection.
Sending the courier cost $11,978 in transportation, $1,927 in accommodations and $1,267 in per diems.
The diplomatic courier did not stay on Bell Island with Trudeau.
Global Affairs has yet to reveal whether the employee was assigned any duties during Trudeau's vacation apart from bringing equipment to the Bahamas at the beginning of the vacation and bringing it back at the end.
Clement said reimbursing the Aga Khan sets a potentially dangerous precedent.
""If it were the case that an outside organization can merely bill the government for perceived costs associated with a government employee being around, you could imagine where this would lead. It would lead to inflated bills that would not be in any way verifiable or justifiable.""

In fact, Khalid Obaidi, the country's defence minister, argued for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government to change its mind in a high-level meeting prior to the suspension of the bombing campaign.
The meeting took place on Dec. 20, 2015, in Baghdad, as Canada's newly appointed defence minister made his first fact-finding trip to the region.
The red carpet — replete with an honour guard — was rolled out for Sajjan, a former soldier with a distinguished career in Afghanistan.
""The ensuing discussion touched on a range of issues, but the Iraqi Minister of Defence was clearly focused on Canada's decision to withdraw its CF18 fighter jets from the coalition air strikes, asking Minister Sajjan to reconsider this decision on numerous occasions,"" said a Global Affairs Canada summary of the meeting, dated Dec. 22, 2015.
The report, obtained by Conservative Party researchers and shared with CBC News, was written by the chargé d'affaires at the Baghdad mission and sent to a senior Global Affairs official in Ottawa who is responsible for Middle Eastern issues in the Gulf states.

The narrative the Liberal government promoted — both before and after Sajjan's meeting — was that Canada's allies understood and respected the decision to call a halt to the air force's participation in the campaign, which started under former prime minister Stephen Harper's Conservative government.
Following the Baghdad meeting, Sajjan flew to the Iraqi city of Erbil, where he had further sessions with Kurdish political and military leaders. Later, during a conference call with reporters back in Canada, he was asked how the withdrawal plan was going over.
""'The irony is, I haven't had one discussion about the CF-18s or discussing our contribution from the humanitarian side of things,"" Sajjan responded when asked how the Kurds, whom Canada had been working with directly, viewed the plan.

Conservative defence critic James Bezan said the Liberal government, and Sajjan in particular, deliberately misled Canadians about the fallout among allies.
""He did lie. This is proof that he lied,"" Bezan said in an interview with CBC News. ""When he said there was no request to keep our CF-18s there, that is a blatant lie.""

A spokeswoman for Sajjan said the context of the question specifically related to how the Kurds felt about the issue and the minister did not say anything misleading.
Jordan Owens told CBC News the issue was not brought up in Erbil and the revamped mission has since proven its worth to allies.
""Since February 2016, when the government of Canada announced the expansion of our whole-of-government approach to the conflict in Iraq and the region, Canada has received praise from allies, including the governments of Iraq, the Kurdish Regional Government and the United States,"" Owens said in a statement on Monday.
""We value the feedback we receive from our allies and the occasions we have to discuss the opportunities and challenges our nations face as we make policy decisions that impact the international community.""
In an interview with , which aired in early January 2016, Sajjan did concede the allies had mixed feelings about Canada's plan.
""Of course they want to keep our CF-18s there,"" he said.
But sticking with the airstrike mission wouldn't be the ""responsible"" thing to do, he added.
""The responsible thing, in my opinion, is to make sure we as a coalition partner look at the current situation, the needs of the coalition,"" he said. ""When you look at the current situation, the conversation is [...] 'How do we target more?'""

The end of combat operations by the jets fulfilled a Liberal 2015 election pledge, and it was a decision supported by the country's top military commander.


It paved the way for the tripling of the number of special forces troops advising Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and the introduction of higher-level intelligence capabilities to help with the liberation of the northern city of Mosul.
When the Liberals announced the revamped mission on Feb. 8, 2016, Gen. Jonathan Vance, the chief of defence staff, said it was the ""absolutely correct moment"" to end air combat operations.
""The success of Iraq is going to be through its forces on the ground and for us to provide them with training and the expertise to be able to do that, to defend themselves and be able to conduct operations to defeat [ISIS] is exactly where we need to be,"" Vance said.
But Bezan said the narrative that allies were not fussed by the decision continued past the end of the bombing campaign, which formally wrapped up less than two weeks after the government announced the retooling.
Sajjan was the point man and the December 2015 comments represented, according to Bezan, the beginning of a series of ""alternative fact"" statements by the minister, which now includes the existence of a """" in the jet fighter fleet.
The Conservatives say the notion that Canada does not have enough CF-18s to meet its NORAD and NATO commitments simultaneously is political fiction, dreamed up by Liberals intent on not buying the F-35 stealth fighter, another of the Liberals' campaign promises.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/sajjan-cf-18s-iraq-1.4053485?cmp=rss

a5af9a7f1b03ce67ef41b7fec4ad30a38ab7e604,Don Pittis,2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,Bombardier reminds us how easy governments make it to forget taxpayer investments: Don Pittis,"Gigantic pay packages for corporate executives always come with an intricate set of justifications, especially after they've generated public outrage.
""Today, Bombardier is a $16-billion high-technology company on a growth path to $25-billion by 2020,"" , head of the group that decides how much Bombardier executives deserve, declared Sunday. Monty himself raked in multimillion-dollar salaries at Nortel and Bell Canada so his opinions are not exactly those of the common working stiff.
Bombardier is actually a $4-billion company, measured in the standard way based on , but in his urgency to convince us that paying executives so much is essential, Monty forgets several things.

Rather than crediting the current set of execs, it is much easier to make a case that repeated investments by Canadian taxpayers created those billions.
This is not a uniquely Canadian phenomenon.


Despite the country's celebration of the free enterprise spirit, the United States has a heavily taxpayer-subsidized private sector.

The term ""privatising profits and socializing losses"" is so widespread it gets its own entry in the U.S. business definition site : ""businesses and individuals can successfully benefit from any and all profits related to their line of business, but avoid losses by having those losses paid for by society.""
In the U.S., outrage over corporate bailouts has come from the right-wing Tea Party movement as much as from anyone on the left.

Here in Canada, it was Conservative leadership candidate Michael Chong who made the best case for putting conditions on government bailouts to companies like Bombardier, saying it would have been better to follow the model of Tory Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, who in 2013 made concessions to Air Canada, granting the company more time to finance its pension fund, which was in deficit at the time.

""The badly needed break was accompanied by strict regulations banning special bonuses, dividends, share repurchases and tying salary increases to the rate of inflation,"" Chong said.
In the current , most of us have probably forgotten Flaherty's help to Air Canada. Most of us have forgotten the many, many bailouts to private sector corporations that have prevented their collapse or sale to foreign companies.
Air Canada and Bombardier are not alone. But in Canada when we read about the success of our private-sector titans and the captains of industry that lead them, the helping hand from taxpayers is almost never mentioned.

We hear about the free market's invisible hand that propels private-sector companies to success, but we hear little about the invisible handout from taxpayers.
From its days as a money-losing snow tractor company, Bombardier has been helped so many times by now-forgotten taxpayer infusions that in many ways it is a creation of the Canadian government, funded by your taxes. A CBC article from three years ago .

Air Canada, a literal creation of the federal government, has been given taxpayer help many times since. CN Rail is similar. Telus was once a government-created and owned company. So was Potash. It is seldom noted that the Alberta Energy Company that developed the oilsands was a taxpayer creation. 
These are not exceptions. Taxpayer support for Canadian industry has been the rule.
Carmaker General Motors got an enormous bailout from the Canadian and Ontario governments after its bankruptcy in 2009 and the previous Conservative government sold off the shares it had taken in partial compensation at a loss.

And it's not just the bailouts. Jean Monty's BCE became a giant because of its original status as federally regulated monopoly. 
This is not necessarily a bad thing. And it is done everywhere. From government military contracts for Boeing and Airbus to the fleet of global companies funded by Beijing, government support for business is a fact worldwide.




Canadians have every reason to be proud of the investments they have made in creating our business giants.
But when it comes to taking the credit, the office in charge of justifying the bosses' pay is always well funded.
There are plenty of reasons given: bosses elsewhere are paid more; the current bosses are irreplaceable; they might run off to get more money someplace else.
If the Bombardier raises — which have been partially  in the face of the backlash — don't go through, will the executives abandon their rich pay packets?
Such justifications are often suspect. At Postmedia, for example, several executives got  and left shortly afterward all while the company was losing money and laying off staff.


From their positions of power, company executives always seem convinced they deserve to be paid more regardless of whether the company is failing or boosted by good luck.
Unless government handouts come with strict rules that prevent giant pay hikes, company bosses seem prone to assuming the improvement in business conditions that follows is simply evidence of their cleverness and hard work.

Conservatives have been warned about their candidate's fatal flaw. Repeatedly. O'Leary's snub of a Conservative leadership debate in Toronto  in favour of a U.S. cable news appearance — live from Miami — to discuss U.S. healthcare reform leaves no doubt over where Kevin O'Leary's interests lie.

The answer you're looking for, Conservatives seduced by this fickle charlatan, is: not in Canada.


If you're still on the fence about this, and if you're a sentient being, you really shouldn't be, O'Leary erased all doubt with one small, simple word: ""we.""

In  U.S. healthcare reform, O'Leary chucked around the word ""we"" liberally, which is a wee bit of a problem when aspiring to lead a political party in another country.


As the cautionary tale of Michael Ignatieff , candidates with tangential attachments to Canada and personal pronoun problems vis-à-vis the United States go over in the same way the Hindenburg did — to pick a reference from a country whose history O'Leary ostensibly understands.

Does anyone supporting Mr. O'Leary — including those on his campaign payroll — remember how thoroughly Conservatives clubbed Iggy with the pronoun truncheon? Running against O'Leary would let the Liberals make the election about personality, and not the failure of Liberal policies.


At this point, the only argument in O'Leary's favour is he would allow Conservatives to bypass the Stéphane Dion era of post-loss rebuilding entirely, and move straight to the aftermath of the Ignatieff immolation, when Justin Trudeau eventually took root and rebuilt his party.

O'Leary's supporters point out his appeal with  and his electability with the broader electorate. Fine, let's have a look under that particular hood.


Conservatives already have zero seats in Atlantic Canada. O'Leary's response? A threat to  the equalization program. Sure, there's a conversation to be had about how to reinvigorate the Atlantic economies, but ask anyone from the Harper era how reforming employment insurance . Tough medicine with a mandate is one thing, threatening it before the election is to guarantee you'll never have the chance to administer it.

Then there's Quebec, the province in which O'Leary has already dug himself a hole with his, um, nascent bilingualism. The silver lining of the Conservative defeat in 2015 was the party's  in Quebec. This mustn't be reversed, let alone set back to square one.

How about the vast rural swathes of Canada that produce reliable Conservative votes, i.e. the ""base."" I'm sure O'Leary  ""there's nothing proud about being a warrior"" will go over well in military communities. Just as his nonchalance about  will go over well in social conservative circles. And what about his  for legal pot? I'm guessing Trudeau will bogart that cohort.

This leaves those who favour a low-tax, small-footprint government that respects provincial jurisdiction. Allow me to introduce you to Maxime Bernier, a genuine libertarian with cabinet experience and a following in Quebec. The experience bit is important: limiting government requires understanding how it works, another area in which O'Leary is .

Fine. Forget Atlantic Canada, forget Quebec, forget the base, and forget small government libertarians. What could O'Leary offer voters in the critical suburban ridings of, say, the Greater Toronto Area (GTA)?


Which brings us back to  night's debate in Eglinton-Lawrence which, last time I checked, is in the GTA.

Not satisfied with merely snubbing the candidates who respected voters enough to present their ideas in person, O'Leary's campaign aimed lower by proffering a false personal note: their man couldn't attend because he was  his 27th wedding anniversary with the missus.

Yes, he was celebrating it, albeit in Miami as mentioned above, which is a little tone deaf. And 27 years is an impressive figure, which demonstrates commitment. But as a soppy cover for skipping the debate, which is what the campaign was clearly aiming for, it was undone the moment his mug popped up on MSNBC.


Worse still, it wasn't the first time O'Leary's ""truthiness"" has been exposed. When he  an event in Winnipeg the other month, he blamed bad weather for a cancelled flight, when in fact no flights were cancelled.

""More than once I assured the member for South Surrey-White Rock that the words I used were not meant to offend her, or embarrass her, and if that was the case I was profoundly sorry,"" Di Iorio said after question period Monday. ""I offered her my deepest apologies.""
""Before all my colleagues here in the House of Commons, I wish to reiterate my most sincere apologies to the member for South Surrey-White Rock and I hope that we can continue our work as I've done throughout my career, with great respect and collegiality,"" he added. 

On March 8, International Women's Day, Di Iorio and Watts were attending an in camera committee meeting when Watts's cellphone rang. According to a media report, the ring prompted Di Iorio to say: ""Where's your pole to slide down on?""
Watts took the comment to mean a stripper pole and issued a statement days later saying that the comment was inappropriate and left her feeling uncomfortable. 
""There should be no place or time where such comments are acceptable. I now leave it in the hands of the prime minister to take whatever actions he feels appropriate.""

On Monday Watts told the House of Commons that everyone has made mistakes and that ""in all of our lives where we have done things we wished we hadn't, or where we said things that we wish we didn't.""
She said she believed this incident could help effect change and that if MPs took the incident as an opportunity to learn a lesson, all would be well-served. 
""I thank my colleague for his apology and his teaching,"" Watts said. ""And I would also ask that he apologize to the committee members and staff and then I ask that we move on.

Yousafzai will also receive honorary Canadian citizenship during the visit, which was bestowed upon her in 2014.
Previous plans to honour her at an event in Toronto on Oct. 22, 2014 were cancelled after a gunman shot and killed reservist Nathan Cirillo at the National War Memorial and stormed Centre Block that same day.
In announcing she would become the sixth person granted honorary Canadian citizenship, then prime minister Stephen Harper cited Yousafzai's bravery in her fight for the rights of women and girls to go to school.

When she was 15, Yousafzai was the target of Taliban assassins after she became an outspoken advocate for her right to attend class. After her recovery, she became an international spokesperson on the issue. She is the youngest-ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize and will be the youngest person to address the Parliament of Canada.
In a statement from the PMO, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, ""Ms. Yousafzai's courageous response to those who threatened her life, and her advocacy for girls' education, has inspired many millions of people around the world. Her story is one of determination and dignity, and Canada is proud to call her an honorary citizen of this great country.""
The PMO release also quoted Yousafzai, who is perhaps best-known by her first name, Malala, as saying, ""The people of Canada are leading the world in their response to the refugee crisis.

Government House leader Jean-Marc Fournier said he was there to listen to the protesters.
He was booed and chased away by the crowd.

The reaction underscores the delicate position that Bombardier has created for the federal and provincial politicians who have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the aerospace company in the past year — funding that spared it the ignominy of filing for bankruptcy.  
In promptly deciding to award themselves a nearly 50 per cent pay raise, Bombardier's senior executives sparked sharp public backlash.

So deep was the anger, the executives agreed over the weekend to forgo a portion of the raise until 2020 and make it contingent on meeting performance targets.

Now politicians in both Quebec City and Ottawa, who once boasted of their investments in the company's CSeries business jet program, are struggling to demonstrate to the electorate that they understand the outrage.    






""Like many Canadians, I had concerns,"" federal Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said Monday at an aerospace industry event in Montreal. 
""I was disappointed, and the company took steps to address the issue.""

It wasn't two months ago that Bains, announcing $372.5 million in federal aid for the company, said he was ""proud"" of the federal government's long-standing relationship with Bombardier.
In the House of Commons, interim Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose asked the prime minister if he was embarrassed by his government's support for Bombardier, given the generous executive pay hike.
""We're obviously not pleased with the decision that Bombardier made around its remuneration for its executives,"" Justin Trudeau replied. But he added the aid was necessary to secure jobs in the aerospace industry.

​Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard, whose government invested $1.3 billion in 2016 for a share in the CSeries program, has been unabashed about the merits of that decision. 
""Bombardier still exists, thanks to us,"" he said in February.  

On Monday, Couillard expressed his ""disappointment"" about the executive pay raise, saying the company ignored the social and economic context in Quebec.

But the premier also sought to keep the criticism in check, stressing the need to maintain a business-friendly environment.
""I understand that there is some dissatisfaction, a bit of frustration,"" Couillard said. ""But remember the reality of this company and its importance for Quebec.""

Bombardier is the largest player in the province's aerospace industry, which employs some 40,000 people. The company's future in that industry —  it also has a large mass-transit division — is largely dependent on the success of the CSeries program. 
After 2½ years of delays, and $2 billion of cost overruns, Bombardier finally started to see orders pick up last year for the single-aisle jet.
U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines Inc. bought 75 CS100 aircraft and has an option for an additional 50 planes. In June, Air Canada announced the purchase of 45 jets, which are marketed for their fuel efficiency and ability to make transatlantic flights.

But despite the increase in demand, Bombardier is undertaking a dramatic overhaul of its employee base. It plans to lay off 14,500 workers worldwide as part of an effort to regain financial health.

Those layoffs, combined with the large government investments, have contributed to the growing indignation over the executive compensation package.
In just a few days, Quebec's small left-leaning party, Québec Solidaire, has collected 25,000 signatures on a petition calling for the provincial government to revisit the terms of its deal with Bombardier. 
Couillard rejected that proposal outright on Monday.

​But his party will be called upon to vote on a motion — expected to be tabled by the Parti Québecois on Tuesday — that asks Bombardier's executives to renounce their 2016 bonuses.
The premier declined to answer whether he would vote for or against the motion, but hinted he prefers the laissez-faire approach.
""If companies would be subjected to direct government influence in their daily management, that is something that would be very negative for the Quebec economy,"" he said.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bombardier-justin-trudeau-philippe-couillard-pay-raise-1.4053138?cmp=rss

Then suddenly, seemingly before some in the room had even begun paying attention, it was over — for now.
Conservative and New Democrats had started a protest at the procedures committee last month, speaking for hours over four days as they tried to prevent the Liberals from passing a motion that would impose a deadline on their study of proposed changes to the way the House of Commons conducts its business.
The opposition filibuster was set to start up again Monday at noon, likely with bluster and bombast from NDP MP David Christopherson, who was raring to go as he spoke to reporters before the meeting began. But then Liberal MP Larry Bagnell, the committee chair, suspended the meeting to allow for more negotiations behind the scenes.
They are scheduled to meet again Wednesday at 4 p.m.

The word was that Opposition House Leader Candice Bergen and NDP House Leader Murray Rankin had headed into a meeting Monday morning with Government House Leader Bardish Chagger, whose discussion paper on suggestions for legislative reform had started this contentious ball rolling in the first place.
""It's nice to see that we are all coming together to have that conversation and hopefully we can work collaboratively together to really modernize the way this place works,"" Chagger told reporters Monday on her way into question period.
That discussion paper proposes changes the Liberals argue are meant to modernize the House of Commons, making it more efficient and relevant.

The ideas include doing away with sparsely attended Friday sittings, or making Fridays like any other day of the week, with the same hours and business to be done.
Other suggestions include allowing electronic voting, scheduling a specific amount of time to debate government bills — as well as deadlines to move it through the legislative process — and creating a special question period one day a week for the prime minister to be the one answering all the questions, as is done in Britain.

Opposition MPs are taking issue with both the suggested changes, which they argue will take away some of what little power remains to opposition MPs, and the way the Liberals have been trying to implement them, especially since they are not guaranteeing a need for unanimity or even consensus before they move ahead.
That includes notice of a motion by Liberal MP Scott Simms to not only have the paper studied by the procedures committee, which would normally be free to set its own agenda, but also have the committee report back on the paper by June 2.

That is what set off the filibuster.
Simms said he welcomed the pause. He also suggested the June 2 deadline is up for discussion — but not an indefinite delay.
""We don't want it to drag on. By the same token, I would be willing to discuss the option of amending June 2,"" Simms said.

Christopherson saw the suspension as a good sign.
""The government is blinking,"" he said Monday. ""The government realizes they're in some trouble and they want now to have some discussions with the House leaders to see if they can get off this dime.""
Bergen, meanwhile, saw the fact that the Liberal chair of the committee had put the filibuster on hold as another power grab.
""They are taking all of our tools away,"" said Bergen.
Bergen said that in her meeting with Chagger, both she and Rankin were clear they were not changing their position.
""The government needs to agree there would be a consensus,"" she said.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/filibuster-delayed-reid-christopherson-1.4053120?cmp=rss

In an appearance at a World Economic Forum event, Bill Morneau cautioned that a tariff-like tax would sting families on both sides of the frontier by disrupting a mutually beneficial trading relationship and imposing extra costs on U.S. firms.
""Our sense is that there would be an initial negative for both economies — and that the negative may be worse for the United States economy,"" Morneau said in a question-and-answer session shortly after he raised his concerns about a border tax in a speech.
""We don't think it's a good idea.""

Morneau's stronger public position against the border tax came after Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr noted last week that the policy faced huge opposition in Washington.
Carr made the comments following a series of meetings in the U.S. capital with lawmakers, administration officials and business people, who he said cast doubts on whether the import tax had any chance of passing in an upcoming omnibus tax bill.

The uncertainty surrounding a border tax has created significant concerns among Canadian companies, many of which rely heavily on exports to the U.S.
Morneau told his audience that the Canadian government had conducted ""extremely preliminary"" assessments on the potential economic impacts of a tax on U.S. imports.
""As you can imagine, there's too many hypotheticals to get to an answer that is absolutely clear in that regard,"" he said.

Morneau also hailed the strength of the countries' partnership and argued cross-border trade and investment have been ""essentially"" balanced over the years.
A border-adjustment tax, he warned, would raise prices for American consumers and could create currency issues with additional challenges of their own.
""Anything, from our perspective, that thickens our border is bad for Americans and bad for Canadians,"" said Morneau, who will visit Indiana on Tuesday to meet Gov. Eric Holcomb and business leaders and visit CN Rail's largest U.S. yard in the city of Gary.

The original border-tax proposal came from Republican leaders in the House of Representatives and is designed to raise revenues to help pay for tax cuts and to repatriate cash and jobs sent overseas by U.S. firms.
The plan would likely rake in a lot of money — the U.S. Tax Foundation estimates US$1.1 trillion over a decade.
However, President Donald Trump has sent mixed messages on the subject and there are signs the border tax would not attract enough support in Washington.
Last week, Democratic lawmaker John Delaney told a panel on Canada-U.S. infrastructure hosted by The Hill newspaper that ""it's never going to happen"" because it doesn't have the votes.
Critics have said the plan would provoke a trade war, international sanctions and make American imports more expensive.
Morneau's comments on the border-tax plan went further than remarks made by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month in Houston.
After delivering a speech, Trudeau said he was ""concerned"" with extra tariffs or new taxes at the border because the economies are so tightly integrated with goods moving back and forth.

Get rid of rent control, CIBC says","Rent control policies implemented more than 20 years ago aimed at helping low-income Ontarians get affordable housing are having the opposite effect now, and making accommodation even harder to find, an economist with the CIBC argues in a new report Tuesday.
Amid calls for even  are allowed to hike rents in Toronto's competitive market, economist Benjamin Tal argues any such policy would do more harm than good — even to those it's ostensibly trying to protect.
""Rent control is the exact opposite of what the [Greater Toronto Area] market needs,"" he says. ""If history is a guide, such policy will mostly hurt the people it's trying to protect.""

Under current rules that were implemented in 1992 and subsequently left in place by every government that followed, buildings built after 1991 aren't subject to any caps on how much a landlord is allowed to raise the rent each year.

But older buildings have a cap on how much the rent can rise every year, regardless of what the costs are or whatever conditions in the free market are.
The plan was to encourage landlords and developers to build more apartment units by removing artificial caps on their potential profits. But more than two decades later, Tal says, the effect has been to fund a boom in condominiums that operate as rental units largely outside of regulation.
Others aren't so sure that less regulation is the answer. The Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario thinks the rules need to be updated to reflect the modern market. 
""The theory is that with an increased supply of units, 'the market' will drive rents down,"" the group says in  on its website. ""The reality is that rents have been increasing across Ontario whether the vacancy rate is high or low.""

Tal argues that rent control on older units causes them to fall into disrepair since landlords have little incentive to maintain them. ""The turnover rate under rent control is lower as tenants stay in properties longer,"" Tal said. ""And naturally, landlords would spend the bare minimum to maintain their units, given that, in many cases, they do not need to attract other tenants.""

Toronto City Councillor Josh Matlow agrees that rules need updating, but disagrees with Tal's view and thinks more rent control is what's needed — not less. The chair of the city's tenant issues committee says the ""arbitrary"" cut-off of 1991 needs to be removed so all buildings are treated the same way.
""The proof is in the pudding,"" he said in an interview. Rent increases have vastly outpaced inflation, which is why he wants the province to update the rules for a modern era.

""There should be strict guidelines for all rentals before and after the arbitrary date of 1991, and a review and reform to ensure above-the-guideline rent increases"" are subject to more scrutiny, Matlow said.
So-called ""above-the-guideline"" rent increases are when landlords make capital repairs and then pass the costs along to the tenant.
Unlike Matlow, Tal blames the problem of when older units fall into disrepair on rent control because there's no incentive to fix them. And people are less willing to move out of rent controlled buildings, which pushes others into the condo market, because few people are building so-called ""purpose-built"" rental units — the industry term for apartment buildings.
More ""rent control will work to reduce the supply of rental units, and will inflate any segment of the market that is not under rent control,"" Tal says.
""More activity will be diverted toward condo construction, a segment of the market that is much more immune to rent control as condo owners have multiple avenues to require a tenant to leave,"" he says.
It's an issue that many at Toronto city hall are keenly aware of Coun. Ana Bailao says the rules on the books today certainly need updating, one way or another.

""It is a delicate balance,"" she told CBC News in an interview. ""We understand this is a complex issue [but] something has to be done, because when people are getting slapped with  it's not acceptable.""

One way or another, Bailao says, rent control regulations need to find a ""balance"" and ""respond to the new reality of what is today — and increasingly so — a different rental market.""
Bailao, who chairs the city's affordable housing committee, has worked with Matlow on the issue and the two will soon present eight recommendations to help regulate Toronto's rental market to the mayor's office. Among the recommendations are a plan to .
For his part, Tal isn't advocating that a completely hands-off government approach would fix all of the city's housing problems. Rather, by coupling increased investment in affordable housing with less rent control, he says the market is more likely to fix itself by removing arbitrary limitations on competition.

Part of the problem with Toronto's housing market, Tal says, is people's willingness to buy in at all costs. And encouraging the current two-tiered rental market will do little to change that attitude.
""Any solution to the region's affordability crisis must include a significant increase in the propensity to rent, mainly among young families,"" Tal says.
Rather than making the rental market even more uncertain than it already is, the best thing government can do on the issue is fix a decades-old mistake by removing rent control entirely, Tal argues.
""Rent in the GTA is now rising much faster than inflation, and rent control is seen as a way to ensure that households on low and middle incomes are not squeezed out of the city,"" he said. 
""While the intentions are pure, the suggested remedy is wrong.""",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cibc-rent-control-1.4053228?cmp=rss

The Topeka, Kan.-based retailer said Tuesday it will immediately close nearly 400 stores as part of the reorganization. It has over 4,400 stores in more than 30 countries, including Canada, and was founded in 1956.
Payless plans to reduce its debt by almost 50 per cent, lower how much it pays in interest and line up funds. The company says some of its lenders have agreed make available up to $385 million to keep the stores running.

The moves come after a weekend report in the New York Times that O'Reilly and his employer paid five women $13 million to settle harassment or other allegations of inappropriate conduct by Fox's star.

Hyundai said it currently has no ads on , but it pulled spots on future episodes. The automaker says it wants to partner with companies and programming that share its values of inclusion and diversity.
BMW said it suspended advertising on the show due to the recent allegations, as did T. Rowe Price and Constant Contact. Allstate said support for women is a company value and it had also suspended advertising on the show.
GlaxoSmithKline said it had ""temporarily put a hold"" on ads on O'Reilly's show while it reviews the situation.

Here's the NHL's dispute with the International Olympic Committee, explained:

For starters, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and the 31 team owners have made it clear from the beginning that they're not interested in paying the costs of travel, accommodations and insurance for their top players to compete in the Olympics.
Those bills, estimated at somewhere around $20 million US for the 2018 Olympics, had been covered by the IOC for previous Games. But, sometime after taking office in the fall of 2013, IOC president Thomas Bach put an end to that arrangement.
Enter the International Ice Hockey Federation. Hockey's world governing body offered back in November to cover those costs.

Problem solved, right? Not so fast. Reports then surfaced that the IIHF's offer wasn't good enough for the NHL, which was seeking something akin to ""top sponsor"" status with the IOC. Such a deal would give the league additional marketing considerations and the use of certain Olympic content on its own platforms.


It seems like the NHL's real beef may be with giving its ""partners"" anything for free — a stance that hockey fans and players are familiar with after enduring three lockouts, including a stoppage that wiped out an entire season, under Bettman's reign.

In making its various demands, the NHL has pounded the talking point that putting its season on hold for 2½ weeks in February is a major concession, and one that ""the overwhelming majority of our clubs are adamantly opposed to,"" according to Monday's statement.
It's debatable, though, how much of this is really a hardship. Interest in the interminable regular season can often wane during the dog days of February, and the owners aren't sacrificing any games — each team still plays 82 times during an Olympic season.

Bach's organization — which bills itself as a ""not-for-profit"" ""movement"" and yet still rakes in billions in sponsorship and media-rights revenue for every Games — wants to continue having the world's best hockey players perform on its stage for free.
The IOC also objects to the idea of giving special treatment to the NHL. In its statement issued in response to the NHL's decision to pull out of Pyeongchang, the IOC noted that it ""distributes 90 per cent of its revenue for the development of sport in the world"" and that it ""obviously cannot treat a national commercial league better than not-for-profit international sports federations which are developing sport globally.""
According to the NHL, the IOC also told the league that its participation in the 2022 Olympics in Beijing — the capital of a massive Chinese market that all pro sports leagues want to tap into — is contingent on its going to Pyeongchang.


In short, to play in the Olympics. As the dispute has played out over the last few months, many players expressed their fondness for representing their country. Russia's Alex Ovechkin, one of hockey's biggest stars,  that he will play in Pyeongchang regardless of the NHL's decision. His boss, Washington Capitals owner Ted Leonsis, has indicated he would be open to accommodating Ovechkin's request, though it's unclear how such an arrangement would work.
The players' desire to be Olympians, though, doesn't mean they're willing to capitulate to their bosses. The players' union in November swiftly rejected the league's offer to let them compete in Pyeongchang in exchange for a three-year extension to the Collective Bargaining Agreement, which has been very good so far to the bottom line for owners. The proposed  was viewed by some as a blunt attempt by the NHL to turn public opinion against the players.

Maybe. The NHL's statement on Monday contains some interesting language. While it ends with a final-sounding sentence (""We now consider the matter officially closed."") nowhere does it actually say that the NHL has definitively decided to skip the 2018 Olympics. Instead, it contains the less-ominous line of ""this will confirm our intention to proceed with finalizing our 2017-18 regular season schedule without any break to accommodate the Olympic Winter Games.""

a5af9a7f1b03ce67ef41b7fec4ad30a38ab7e604,Don Pittis,2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,Bombardier reminds us how easy governments make it to forget taxpayer investments: Don Pittis,"Gigantic pay packages for corporate executives always come with an intricate set of justifications, especially after they've generated public outrage.
""Today, Bombardier is a $16-billion high-technology company on a growth path to $25-billion by 2020,"" , head of the group that decides how much Bombardier executives deserve, declared Sunday. Monty himself raked in multimillion-dollar salaries at Nortel and Bell Canada so his opinions are not exactly those of the common working stiff.
Bombardier is actually a $4-billion company, measured in the standard way based on , but in his urgency to convince us that paying executives so much is essential, Monty forgets several things.

Rather than crediting the current set of execs, it is much easier to make a case that repeated investments by Canadian taxpayers created those billions.
This is not a uniquely Canadian phenomenon.


Despite the country's celebration of the free enterprise spirit, the United States has a heavily taxpayer-subsidized private sector.

The term ""privatising profits and socializing losses"" is so widespread it gets its own entry in the U.S. business definition site : ""businesses and individuals can successfully benefit from any and all profits related to their line of business, but avoid losses by having those losses paid for by society.""
In the U.S., outrage over corporate bailouts has come from the right-wing Tea Party movement as much as from anyone on the left.

Here in Canada, it was Conservative leadership candidate Michael Chong who made the best case for putting conditions on government bailouts to companies like Bombardier, saying it would have been better to follow the model of Tory Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, who in 2013 made concessions to Air Canada, granting the company more time to finance its pension fund, which was in deficit at the time.

""The badly needed break was accompanied by strict regulations banning special bonuses, dividends, share repurchases and tying salary increases to the rate of inflation,"" Chong said.
In the current , most of us have probably forgotten Flaherty's help to Air Canada. Most of us have forgotten the many, many bailouts to private sector corporations that have prevented their collapse or sale to foreign companies.
Air Canada and Bombardier are not alone. But in Canada when we read about the success of our private-sector titans and the captains of industry that lead them, the helping hand from taxpayers is almost never mentioned.

We hear about the free market's invisible hand that propels private-sector companies to success, but we hear little about the invisible handout from taxpayers.
From its days as a money-losing snow tractor company, Bombardier has been helped so many times by now-forgotten taxpayer infusions that in many ways it is a creation of the Canadian government, funded by your taxes. A CBC article from three years ago .

Air Canada, a literal creation of the federal government, has been given taxpayer help many times since. CN Rail is similar. Telus was once a government-created and owned company. So was Potash. It is seldom noted that the Alberta Energy Company that developed the oilsands was a taxpayer creation. 
These are not exceptions. Taxpayer support for Canadian industry has been the rule.
Carmaker General Motors got an enormous bailout from the Canadian and Ontario governments after its bankruptcy in 2009 and the previous Conservative government sold off the shares it had taken in partial compensation at a loss.

And it's not just the bailouts. Jean Monty's BCE became a giant because of its original status as federally regulated monopoly. 
This is not necessarily a bad thing. And it is done everywhere. From government military contracts for Boeing and Airbus to the fleet of global companies funded by Beijing, government support for business is a fact worldwide.




Canadians have every reason to be proud of the investments they have made in creating our business giants.
But when it comes to taking the credit, the office in charge of justifying the bosses' pay is always well funded.
There are plenty of reasons given: bosses elsewhere are paid more; the current bosses are irreplaceable; they might run off to get more money someplace else.
If the Bombardier raises — which have been partially  in the face of the backlash — don't go through, will the executives abandon their rich pay packets?
Such justifications are often suspect. At Postmedia, for example, several executives got  and left shortly afterward all while the company was losing money and laying off staff.


From their positions of power, company executives always seem convinced they deserve to be paid more regardless of whether the company is failing or boosted by good luck.
Unless government handouts come with strict rules that prevent giant pay hikes, company bosses seem prone to assuming the improvement in business conditions that follows is simply evidence of their cleverness and hard work.

ed10126c798d44baee1963700b3718f75cd7eb51,The Associated Press,2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,Trump: U.S. will only fund shovel-ready infrastructure projects,"With legislation overhauling taxes and health care on an uncertain path, U.S. president Donald Trump returned to the familiar. Trump brought 52 business leaders from New York City to the White House Tuesday to talk about another favourite campaign issue — infrastructure and economic growth.
The U.S. economy has so far proven to be a point of pride for a presidency that has otherwise gotten off to a rocky start. Trump inherited a stable economy from former President Barack Obama, an economic recovery that's heading toward its eighth year. But Trump believes he can do more for business.


Trump and several of his top aides emphasized plans to cut red tape and jumpstart infrastructure projects at Tuesday's meeting, while also previewing for the CEOs other priorities that include shortening flight times for airplanes, increasing the power grid's efficiency and targeting programs to improve job training.
At one point the president had an aide come on stage to hold up a long scroll of the government's approval process for building a highway. The president then pledged to eliminate more than 90 per cent of the regulations involved and ""still have safety."" He provided no details.

The administration has committed to directing as much as $1 trillion for infrastructure over the next decade, although it has yet to release policy specifics. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao recently said she expects a plan will be unveiled later this year.
But getting a measure through Congress could be difficult given the Republican majority in both chambers and their desire to reduce tax rates as much as possible. An infrastructure plan that relies on direct funding could possibly raise the budget deficit more than one that uses tax credits.
Trump touted the plan he says is in the works, telling the room, ""We're talking about a very major infrastructure bill of a trillion dollars, perhaps even more.""
Administration officials stressed that it can take more than eight years between funding and the start of project construction, a timeline White House officials say is too slow given the commitment of hundreds of billions of dollars a year.

Trump wanted the CEOs gathered at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building — many of them involved in real estate — to start building roadways, airports, railways, bridges and other infrastructure as quickly as possible.
""If you have a job that you can't start within 90 days, we're not going to give you money for it,"" Trump said.
The president followed up his remarks at the town hall by giving an afternoon speech to the Building Trades Union, pledging to ""rebuild our nation.""

At the CEO town hall, Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, noted that infrastructure upgrades could help growth.
A new air traffic control system that relied on GPS instead of radar would shorten flights and save on jet fuel, helping consumers, he said. Cohn also suggested updates to the power grid to avoid the loss of 20 per cent of electricity in transmission. Trump's daughter Ivanka spoke to the CEOs about the value of job training.
The sales pitch with its technocratic angle seemed perfectly targeted for the assembled business leaders.
""It's terrific in terms of the stuff you're trying to do to modernize the government, educate and so forth,"" said Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of the Blackstone Group, an investment firm, and chairman of the president's policy forum.
""The outside world doesn't always get the message that that's really what is going on,"" he said.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-business-leaders-meeting-april-1.4054536?cmp=rss

Statistics Canada reported Tuesday that imports only increased by a little bit — 0.6 per cent to be precise. But the balance flipped to a sizable deficit because exports plunged. Exports were lower in 8 out of 11 subsectors tracked by the statistics agency.
All in all, exports were down by 2.4 per cent from January's record high level, to $45.3 billion. Exports of just about everything decreased, including farm, fishing and intermediate food products, aircraft and other transportation equipment and parts, as well as consumer goods.
""After a huge January for the Canadian economy, it looks as though we could be in for some payback in the February data,"" Bank of Montreal economist Benjamin Reitzes said.

One of the biggest drop-offs was canola, exports of which declined by 33.7 per cent to $552 million in the month. ""This followed three consecutive monthly increases during which exports of canola more than doubled, reflecting higher Chinese demand for Canadian canola,"" Statistics Canada said.
While down from January's record level, Canada's overall exports are still up by 4.4 per cent compared to the same month a year ago.
""February's weakness notwithstanding, the outlook for export growth in Canada remains solid,"" TD economist James Marple said.

The lawsuit was filed on Monday in Tacoma, Washington, federal court by three EpiPen purchasers. It claims Mylan engaged in a scheme with pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs — companies that act as intermediaries between pharmacies, insurers, and drug companies — to dominate the market and overcharge consumers.

Although other lawsuits have been filed over EpiPen pricing, Monday's is the first to focus on the role of PBMs and to bring claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a federal law historically used against organized crime.
Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin declined to comment.

The EpiPen, acquired by Mylan in 2007, is a hand-held device that treats life-threatening allergic reactions by automatically injecting a dose of epinephrine. The company now sells a .
The plaintiffs in Monday's lawsuit say Mylan paid large rebates to PBMs so they would favor EpiPen over competitors. In helping Mylan control 95 per cent of the epinephrine auto-injector market, the rebates artificially inflated EpiPen's sticker price, resulting in higher costs for many patients, the suit said.

The lawsuit says the three largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers — CVS Caremark, part of CVS Health; Express Scripts Holding Co and OptumRX, part of UnitedHealth Group Inc — aided Mylan's alleged scheme. They were not named as defendants.
The plaintiffs are seeking damages to represent a nationwide class of EpiPen purchasers. Mylan has grappled with a growing backlash from U.S. consumers over the price of EpiPen in the last year. Other class action lawsuits have been filed against Mylan over the pricing of EpiPen, including two currently consolidated in Kansas federal court. However, they have not focused on the role of PBMs.

The company is also under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and said last September that it had agreed to a  with the U.S. Justice Department over how the drug was classified for government buyers. The Justice Department has not confirmed the settlement.

Mylan Chief Executive Officer Heather Bresch has said that the company makes only about $100 per EpiPen pack, and that most consumers pay less than $50 for a two-pack.
The plaintiffs in Monday's lawsuit said Bresch falsely tried to paint Mylan as a ""victim"" of a flawed healthcare system and avoid its own responsibility in setting rebates.

Is her collection doomed?,"Ivanka supporters have complained that it's unfair for people to boycott her line simply because they don't like her father's politics.

But Grab Your Wallet supporters claim she's complicit in the president's policies, especially now that she has secured an official, unpaid position in the White House.

""She's clearly part of what I consider to be the problem,"" said boycotter Amanda Dexter, who lives in Wakefield, Que.



Although some retailers are backing away from Ivanka Trump merchandise, it's still up for debate whether or not the link to her father's administration is helping or hurting sales.

Ivanka built her brand by targeting young, professional working women, says marketing expert, Joanne McNeish. But these people tend not to be Trump supporters.

""When you change your brand values and they're no longer consistent with your current target audience, your current target audience tends to leave you,"" says the Ryerson University professor.


However, Ivanka's company recently  that sales have been soaring since the beginning of February.
Lyst, a London-based e-commerce website, has also reported a spike in Ivanka Trump sales in both February and March.


Certainly, some Trump supporters may be making a point of buying her products because of the boycott.

""Just emailed goodbye letter to Bed Bath Beyond,"" announced one supporter on the Ivanka Trump company . ""Need to know WHERE to shop to support her.""



Ivanka Trump may also be experiencing a bump in sales due to the free publicity her brand is getting, thanks to her heightened profile.

She has taken a leave of absence from her company while working in the White House. But she still profits from sales and still wears her line.

Last week, the U.K. Daily Mail posted photos of her dressed ""head-to-toe"" in a floral dress, handbag and shoes from her collection. Ivanka ""looked ready for spring"" stated an  listing retail prices for her ensemble.
Also, members of the administration have  for the brand, including the president, who chastised Nordstrom for cutting back sales.






But the free publicity could lead to trouble for Ivanka's company down the road, because it has sparked conflict-of-interest allegations.

Last month, a proposed  was filed on behalf of women's clothing retailers throughout California. It accuses the company of unfairly benefiting from Ivanka's ties to the White House.
""Defendants continue to fail to take appropriate steps to avoid exploiting public office for private gain,"" alleges the statement of claim.

Now that Ivanka has taken an official job in the White House, cries of conflict of interest may grow louder.

Seven months ago she entered the business of selling honey, and she is now selling her product on store shelves in every province in the country. 
Horsley is one of a number of entrepreneurs spurning the downturn to start a new business, according to city data.
In fact, she credits some of her sweet success to the sluggish Calgary economy: it compelled her to try her absolute hardest. 

""It was motivation for me to do something better than maybe I wouldn't have thought twice about if the economy was better,"" said Horsley, who launched Drizzle Honey. 
Her honey is in 65 stores right now. Her goal is to reach 200 stores by the end of the year. The poor economic climate in the province is also why Horsley branched out. 
""I knew Calgary wasn't going to be maybe the be-all and end-all of where I could have the product, so it forced me to reach out and say 'OK, Alberta's not doing great, let's look at some other retail avenues.'""

Starting a new businesses is always risky and the success rate is low. Launching in a slow economy is all the more difficult.

""People are more cautious now about spending their dollars,"" said Ali Asghari, who holds the North American distribution rights for an organic energy drink called Pilot's Friend. ""Yes, we will have a bigger challenge.""
So far, Asghari is selling the drink in some specialty stores and fitness centres in Calgary, while negotiating to be carried by a national supermarket chain. 

Alberta is still recovering from the oil price crash in 2014 as energy companies cut spending and eliminated tens of thousands of jobs. Many well-known stores and restaurants in Calgary have closed during the downturn, but just as many new shops are opening.
About 7,200 businesses closed in 2016, while almost 7,400 new shops and stores opened, according to business licence data kept by the City of Calgary. The difference is that more of the new businesses are likely home-based.
Alberta's economy is expected to grow , and that has some entrepreneurs optimistic about their future.
""While times are tough — and they certainly are — people, Calgarians, Albertans are really resilient,"" said Mike Wenzlawe, a partner in a new coffee company. ""You're looking at the economic climate in Calgary right now — it is really starting to bounce back. There's new cafes, new restaurants, new businesses popping up almost daily, and I think Alberta will be built on the backs of entrepreneurs moving forward."" 

Wenzlawe and his friend Jamie Parker fought wildfires in Alberta for several years before starting Calgary Heritage Roasting, which sells roast-to-order coffee and teaches how to roast coffee at home. The pair will open their first store this summer.
""When it came to us starting our own company,"" said Parker, ""we already knew the risks involved and what we were potentially facing.""


One of the well-known people in the Calgary business scene has noticed the mood has improved in the city since oil prices hit rock-bottom.
""This is not a ghost town. The Monty Python line: 'We're not dead yet,'"" said Brett Wilson, the former  star. ""There is activity going on all over the place, so to think that we have shut it down is wrong.""
While entrepreneurs are optimistic about the city's prospects, Wilson seems to be more cautious. He still sees the need for oil prices to rise and for oilpatch companies to increase spending in order for the city and province to get back on their feet.
""Until we actually start spending money and have the rigs working, have the engineers working, have the completions, the tie-ins, pipelines, the gathering system, the marketing teams — all of those things have to be engaged and active to put our economy back on track,"" said Wilson.


While he doesn't expect another oil boom in the province anytime soon, Wilson says energy companies will start re-investing in Alberta once their balance sheets improve.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-startups-business-brett-wilson-1.4052873?cmp=rss

In an appearance at a World Economic Forum event, Bill Morneau cautioned that a tariff-like tax would sting families on both sides of the frontier by disrupting a mutually beneficial trading relationship and imposing extra costs on U.S. firms.
""Our sense is that there would be an initial negative for both economies — and that the negative may be worse for the United States economy,"" Morneau said in a question-and-answer session shortly after he raised his concerns about a border tax in a speech.
""We don't think it's a good idea.""

Morneau's stronger public position against the border tax came after Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr noted last week that the policy faced huge opposition in Washington.
Carr made the comments following a series of meetings in the U.S. capital with lawmakers, administration officials and business people, who he said cast doubts on whether the import tax had any chance of passing in an upcoming omnibus tax bill.

The uncertainty surrounding a border tax has created significant concerns among Canadian companies, many of which rely heavily on exports to the U.S.
Morneau told his audience that the Canadian government had conducted ""extremely preliminary"" assessments on the potential economic impacts of a tax on U.S. imports.
""As you can imagine, there's too many hypotheticals to get to an answer that is absolutely clear in that regard,"" he said.

Morneau also hailed the strength of the countries' partnership and argued cross-border trade and investment have been ""essentially"" balanced over the years.
A border-adjustment tax, he warned, would raise prices for American consumers and could create currency issues with additional challenges of their own.
""Anything, from our perspective, that thickens our border is bad for Americans and bad for Canadians,"" said Morneau, who will visit Indiana on Tuesday to meet Gov. Eric Holcomb and business leaders and visit CN Rail's largest U.S. yard in the city of Gary.

The original border-tax proposal came from Republican leaders in the House of Representatives and is designed to raise revenues to help pay for tax cuts and to repatriate cash and jobs sent overseas by U.S. firms.
The plan would likely rake in a lot of money — the U.S. Tax Foundation estimates US$1.1 trillion over a decade.
However, President Donald Trump has sent mixed messages on the subject and there are signs the border tax would not attract enough support in Washington.
Last week, Democratic lawmaker John Delaney told a panel on Canada-U.S. infrastructure hosted by The Hill newspaper that ""it's never going to happen"" because it doesn't have the votes.
Critics have said the plan would provoke a trade war, international sanctions and make American imports more expensive.
Morneau's comments on the border-tax plan went further than remarks made by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month in Houston.
After delivering a speech, Trudeau said he was ""concerned"" with extra tariffs or new taxes at the border because the economies are so tightly integrated with goods moving back and forth.

The March 22 auction brought in $472 million, the government said Monday.

But over the next 15 auctions, to the end of the compliance period in 2020, the market can probably expect ""a reasonable amount of volatility and unpredictability,"" said Environment Minister Glen Murray.
""The participation rate, whether it's 100 per cent or 20 per cent or 50 per cent or 60 per cent or 13 per cent, is not the success of the market,"" he said. ""The success of the market is really based on our ability to reduce [greenhouse gases]. We will not expect to get 100 per cent all the time.""

The system aimed at lowering greenhouse gas emissions puts caps on the amount of pollution companies in certain industries can emit. If they exceed those limits, they must buy an equal number of allowances at auction or from other companies that come in under their limits.
Most large emitters in Ontario are receiving allowances for free until 2020, which the government says is meant to prevent them from moving to jurisdictions without carbon pricing. But for now certain electricity importers, natural gas distributors and fuel suppliers are among those required to participate.
Bidders in the first auction included Union Gas, Enbridge Gas, Imperial Oil, the Greater Toronto Airports Authority, the city of Kingston, Ont., the University of Guelph, Ontario Power Generation, Apotex, Labatt, BP Canada Energy Group, Shell Energy North America and Suncor Energy Products Partnership.

The provincial Liberal government hopes the quarterly auctions will bring in $1.9 billion a year, to be invested in programs that reduce emissions and help businesses and consumers adapt to a low-carbon economy.
The auction floor price was $18.07 and the actual traded price was $18.08. Murray said he was pleased about that because he wanted the actual price to be as low as possible.
""One of the objectives of cap and trade is to manage the transition to a low carbon economy at the lowest-possible prices to Ontarians and Ontario businesses,"" he said. ""So we didn't want to see early upward movement on that.""
Since Jan. 1, cap and trade has added 4.3 cents per litre to the price of gasoline and about $80 a year to natural gas home heating costs, in addition to indirect costs that will be passed on to consumers.

The results of the central bank's , released Monday morning, reflect increasing business confidence after two years of weakness triggered by the 2014 plunge in oil prices. That sentiment continues a trend noted in .


Fifty-one per cent of surveyed businesses said they expected to have more employees over the next 12 months, compared to 15 per cent who expected lower employment. The number of firms planning to hire more is now at its highest level since late 2014, when oil prices began their precipitous decline.
An improving sales outlook from surveyed businesses has been fuelled by ""an expected rebound in energy-related activity,"" said the report, as well as ""favourable effects of the weaker Canadian dollar for exports and the tourism sector.""
""Meanwhile, some firms believe that activity in sectors experiencing robust growth (such as housing and automobiles) could soon level off,"" said the report.
Canadian businesses expect higher commodity prices to increase costs, reported the bank.
""A few also cited regulatory factors, such as cap-and-trade policies in Ontario and the carbon tax in Alberta, as contributing to their input price growth.""
The survey offers ""plenty of signs that the worst of the oil price shock is behind the Canadian economy,"" wrote Robert Kavcic, of BMO Economics in a note.

More and more Canadian firms are optimistic about U.S. economic growth during the Trump administration, which could possibly open new export opportunities. Benefits could also come from the Keystone XL pipeline and possible U.S. infrastructure spending, the surveyed companies said.
That optimism remains tempered, however, by the possible risks from Trump's unpredictable agenda.
""These risks include increased protectionism, reduced competitiveness of Canadian firms in the event of corporate tax cuts in the United States, and possible delays in the implementation of pro-growth U.S. policies,"" said the report.

The Bank of Canada is ""undoubtedly pleased with today's report,"" wrote TD Economics senior economist Brian DePratto, adding that ""it may be reasonable to expect solid economic momentum as we head into the remainder of 2017. ""
Still, the bank is ""not likely to change the dovish tone of recent communications,"" wrote DePratto, referring to the bank's position on interest rates.

In monetary policy circles, ""dovish"" implies being in favour of lower rates. It's the opposite of ""hawkish,"" which is the term for those who favour higher rates.

The Bank of Canada will release its next interest rate decision on April 12. All 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the bank to keep interest rates steady.

The aircraft- and train-maker landed in hot water last week over its plan to give six members of its leadership team large bonuses — in most cases an increase of up to 50 per cent — in a year when the company spun its wheels. Last year, the Quebec government bailed out the company with $1 billion, and  in federal funds as recently as February.

Two Quebec cabinet ministers called for Bombardier to rethink the pay packages last week, and roughly 200 people gathered outside the company's Montreal headquarters on Sunday to voice their anger against Bombardier.
""If it's private money they can do what they want, but now it's public money,"" said Jessica Lacombe, a teacher who attended the protest. ""It's our taxes, it's our money.""

In response to the backlash, the company made a concession late Sunday evening and announced the new plan will be to delay — but not reduce — the payouts to executives, as long as the company hits certain performance targets.
""This deferred compensation will only be payable if the company achieves performance goals that position it for long-term success, in line with the company's strategic plan,"" the company said in a statement.

In an interview with CBC Radio's  show in Montreal, CEO Alain Bellemare acknowledged he ""can understand why people were so angry,"" because the company didn't do a good job of communicating the reasons behind their compensation policies.
""We were doing this to attract top talent because we need that to put the company back on the right track,"" Bellemare said.""
""It will be payable only — and only if — we deliver on our financial goals,"" he said.
One of those goals is to make Bombardier more than five times more valuable by then as it is today. ""These objectives will be based on our strategic plan for 2020, which aims to transform Bombardier into a $25 billion company,"" spokesperson Simon Letendre told CBC News in a statement.
At the current share price, Bombardier is worth just over $4.6 billion.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bombardier-executive-compensation-1.4052533?cmp=rss

Bell MTS customers affected by the agreement will be notified by mail and will keep their current phone numbers after the switch.
The two telecommunications companies reached the deal as part of the $3.9 billion friendly takeover of Manitoba Telecom Services by Bell, announced last May.

At the time, Bell's parent BCE said it had agreed to sell about one-third of Manitoba Telecom's monthly contract wireless customers and one-third of the MTS stores in Manitoba to Vancouver-based Telus Corp.
Those agreements were subject to various federal approvals and Telus provided an update in February saying it would assume only about one-quarter of the MTS customers.

He prefers to call it machine learning.
Lipton, who used to earn his living as a musician, would be a dream example for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who are hoping to retrain Canada's underemployed to serve a  industry. 
But the AI whiz says retraining may not be enough to prevent a wave of social disruption when the tech economy leaves the poor and middle class behind. 

Lipton is not one to scoff at the opportunities offered by retraining.
""My employment prospects are considerably greater owing to machine learning than they were five years ago when I was playing saxophone in New York for 50 bucks and drinks tickets,"" says Lipton, on the phone from Palo Alto, Calif.
After deciding in his late 20s to switch from playing the sax to playing with computers, Lipton is now a paid adviser to the giant online retailer Amazon and has just been head-hunted as a professor by Carnegie Mellon University. He hasn't even completed his PhD.

Also last week, Lipton made a splash in tech circles with his blog post, , one of a series of articles he is planning under the rubric Approximately Correct.

In Canada there has been an outbreak of coverage on artificial intelligence as Canadian governments and businesses invest in AI research, including the new .
""By encouraging cutting-edge technology like AI while at the same time creating a culture of lifelong learning, we will be with Canadians every step of the way as they lead us into a future filled with possibility,"" said Morneau at last week's institute launch.

Lipton agrees that the technology is valuable in many areas, especially in such things as improving the efficiency of medical systems. But he worries that so much attention by the popular media on what he calls ""artificial general intelligence"" and intelligent killer robots means critics mistakenly suggest that AI is dangerously powerful.

""Another worry is that AI is not that strong, but it's good enough to be convenient,"" says Lipton. The terms AI and ""neural networks"" lead the misinformed to imagine these systems replicate human intelligence, something he says won't happen for a long time, if ever.
He offers the example of a Facebook algorithm that throws up fake news over important news. He has seen ostensibly impartial AI systems, intended to predict prison recidivism rates, which embed racial discrimination.

But like many other Silicon Valley computer prodigies, his biggest worry has little to do with mathematics or science. Lipton, who studied economics as an undergraduate, fears that AI is fundamentally transforming the economy to take humans out of the equation.
Traditional economics tells us that capital and labour are complementary. More ovens (capital) are no good without more bakers (labour). But we are at a watershed where that may have changed.
""I think now with automation we'll be investing in capital for the purpose of replacing labour,"" says Lipton. 
A survey last year of CEOs by the executive search firm  showed 44 per cent said ""robotics, automation and artificial intelligence (AI) will make people 'largely irrelevant' in the future of work.""
That kind of thinking worries Richard Mueller, head of economics at Alberta's University of Lethbridge. He observes that everyone imagines driverless cars and trucks are coming in the distant future, including his brother-in-law, who drives a giant truck at the coal mine in Elkford, B.C. But within the controlled conditions of private mine sites, driverless trucks are already being used around the world.

""Those guys are ripe for replacement almost immediately,"" says Mueller, who has given a series of lectures on the future of work in the automation age.
No one can predict the future, and so far the unemployment rates in Canada and the U.S. have been falling. But a new study from the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research has observed that automation is .

While Both Mueller and Lipton support the idea of retraining, they fear that many of those disinclined to technical skills may never be able to earn a good living in a market economy.
Mueller worries that as AI improves and gets cheaper, many of the jobs left for humans will be those so badly paid they are not worth replacing with a machine.
Lipton, who thinks the solution may ultimately require a redistribution of wealth from capital to labour, thinks that the biggest problem could be helping those whose jobs have been stolen by smart machines to find meaningful lives.









""The one thing we shouldn't automate is music,"" quips the sax man. ""We'll teach everyone to play jazz. Your purpose in life is to swing.""

0412a797cad74f6cc98c9a2b217d145ae64b4d99,Solomon Israel,2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,Canadian? Curious about cannabis? Here are some answers,"Full legalization of marijuana appears to be , which will make Canada just the second nation in the world after Uruguay to completely legalize the cultivation, sale and possession of the drug for medical and recreational purposes.
With lots still unknown before the legislation is unveiled, Canadians have questions about how legalized marijuana will work.
CBC News business reporter Jacqueline Hansen and cbc.ca writer Solomon Israel responded to some of those questions — and comments — during a live chat on Thursday. Here's a sample.


You can watch the full Q&amp;A here:






Taxes could be shared between the federal government (responsible for licensing and regulating producers), provincial governments (in charge of setting prices and determining how marijuana is sold), and municipal governments (which can tax within their own jurisdictions).
The federal Task Force on Cannabis Legalization and Regulation recommended the federal government ""commit to using revenue from cannabis as a source of funding for administration … research and enforcement,""  as well as ""a source of funding for prevention, education and treatment.""
Still, the task force felt that ""revenue generation should be a secondary consideration for all governments, with the protection and promotion of public health and safety as the primary goals.""
Expect the federal government to keep those recommendations in mind as it prepares for legalization.



In January, Toronto-area MP  he believes all illegal drugs should be decriminalized and eventually legalized.
But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau closed the door on that idea on March 2, when he said his government was not considering legalizing any other illicit drugs.





It's a bit more complicated than that.
The Liberal government said it plans to limit home marijuana growers to , in line with the task force's recommendations. (The task force also recommended that plants be limited to 100 centimetres in height.)
The current medical marijuana regulations in Canada went into effect on Aug.24, 2016. Those  evolved from court challenges to previous regulatory regimes.
The first regulatory system was implemented in 2001, before Stephen Harper's government took power. The next took effect in 2013, during Harper's tenure. Those rules would have prohibited home growing, but were ultimately reformed after a successful court challenge.
The current rules for growing marijuana for medical purposes are complex. The amount of marijuana that can be grown by a registered patient depends on how much marijuana they've been prescribed per day. The government  — but in short, registered medical marijuana users in Canada can be allowed to grow much more than just six plants.


As CBC journalists, we don't take a position on that question. But CBC has revealed that the federal government will set the minimum legal age to use marijuana at 18. The provinces will be able to increase that age if they like.
In U.S. states where recreational marijuana has been legalized, the minimum age for marijuana use is 21, in line with the minimum age for buying and using alcohol.
If the provinces set different ages for marijuana purchases, as they do for buying alcohol, young Canadians could end up seeking out jurisdictions where they're old enough.



We don't know, but it's easy to imagine some Canadians will want to try their hands at cannabis agriculture once it's legal. Data on legal home growing in the U.S. remains scarce.
Keep in mind: Canadians may be less enthusiastic about growing marijuana at home if the regulations turn out to be strict.
In Colorado, for example, residents who grow for recreational use are allowed to grow up to six plants per state resident over the age of 21. Home growers have to take security measures like growing their plants in a completely enclosed and locked area.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/legalized-marijuana-questions-2018-1.4049808?cmp=rss

Correspondence between Fintrac and the Canadian Real Estate Association, obtained by The Canadian Press through an Access to Information request, shows that the industry group was concerned that the reference would encourage agents to stop doing business with people based on their ethnicity.
The draft guidance document was aimed at helping companies meet their obligations to detect money laundering and terrorist financing.

It lists several examples of factors that may increase a company's risk of becoming entangled in financial crimes, including dealing with ""a specific ethnic community that is currently dealing with specific events (e.g. prevalence of terrorism or money laundering, war, etc.) in the home country.""
Such a reference would constitute a violation of the Human Rights Act, the real estate association said in its letter.
""Canadians are rightly proud of the Human Rights Act, and especially in this day and age when we see what's happening south of the border,"" said CREA spokesman Randall McCauley.
""Our lawyers would have rightly pointed out or reminded Fintrac that no Canadian can discriminate against another or deny access to a service based on where they're from.""

The federal agency says it was not referring to any particular ethnic community in the document.
""The intent of the guidance was to highlight, broadly, that regulated businesses may deal with clients that have a material connection to high-risk jurisdictions or other jurisdictions that are currently dealing with specific events, including terrorism or money laundering, war, a high level of corruption, or organized crime,"" Fintrac spokeswoman Renee Bercier said in an email.
""Fintrac chose to remove the terminology as it recognized the potential for misinterpretation and misrepresentation.""
Companies in certain sectors — including banks, casinos and real estate firms — are legally required to identify their clients, keep records and report suspicious or large cash transactions to Fintrac. They are also required to assess their exposure to money laundering and terrorism financing risk.

Canada's real estate sector has become an area of particular concern after a report released last fall by the Paris-based Financial Action Take Force said it is susceptible to the illegal dumping of cash.
Fintrac provided CREA with the draft of its guidance document in 2014.
In a letter to Fintrac dated Dec. 23, 2014, CREA calls the reference to ethnicity in the document ""inappropriate,"" particularly if read alongside another section of the guide that encourages companies to introduce measures that can be used to terminate business relationships, a process referred to as ""de-marketing.""

""If this guidance were followed it could result in realtor members being liable for violating human rights law,"" the letter reads, before going on to cite Sec. 5 of Canada's Human Rights Act.
That section says it is a discriminatory practice to deny access to any good, service, facility or accommodation to someone for any of the prohibited grounds of discrimination.
In a response letter dated Feb. 6, 2015, Fintrac says it opted to remove the references to ethnicity and de-marketing.
The reference to ethnicity — and the decision to remove it — illustrates just how controversial the issue has become in the debate over foreign capital flowing into Canada's real estate market.
Thomas Davidoff, an associate professor at the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business, says affordability concerns in markets like Vancouver and Toronto have in some cases resulted in ethnic divisions.
""People get their underwear in a bunch when they're feeling threatened about having a roof over their head,"" says Davidoff.
For instance, reports of money flowing into Vancouver's housing market from China have resulted in some Vancouverites blaming the Chinese for pricing them out of the market for single-family, detached homes, says Davidoff.
""Politicians and government needs to protect citizens while being tolerant and encouraging people to behave decently towards other people,"" he said. ""That can be a challenge.""",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/fintrac-money-laundering-ethnicity-1.4051944?cmp=rss

Kraeker and Tim O'Shea, another McMaster University doctor, have started  (Hamilton Social Medicine Response Team), a program where they visit the elderly, the immobile, the addicted, the homeless and others who have fallen through the cracks of the health-care system.

They spend the day visiting people wherever they are, whether at a shelter, a coffee shop or darkened apartments in Hamilton's lower city. In essence, they are Hamilton's street doctors.

""We'll basically see anybody, anywhere,"" says O'Shea as he rides shotgun.
""The idea is to try this for a year and see how it goes.""

It's a departure for the doctors, who are learned specialists at the top of their game. Kraeker is an internist at Juravinski Hospital and an assistant professor in McMaster University's general internal medicine division. He also does internal medicine education in Namibia. O'Shea is an associate professor. specializes in internal medicine and infectious disease, and has been an 


Doing clinic rounds, they saw patients with the same issues — people with no family doctors and no idea how to find one, addicts afraid to get help for fear of judgment, elderly patients who couldn't leave the house. 
HamSmart patients come from various places. They're referred by social workers, or homeless shelters, or family doctors. Sometimes they're referrals by paramedics or police officers.

""There's a lack of family doctors,"" Kraeker says. ""A lack of quick followup. Just lack of access to health care. It's shocking how many people don't know how to access the health-care system beyond going to the emergency room.""


This particular morning, their first patient is Hank, a double amputee with cardiopulmonary disorder. Hank's scooter is broken, so he spends most days parked in front of the TV. His ex-wife brings him cigarettes and food.


Kraeker and O'Shea enter to find Hank sitting shirtless in front of the TV. He hasn't been sleeping well, he tells them. Kraeker worries sleeping pills will conflict with Hank's multiple other health issues. Try melatonin to start, Kraeker tells him, and offers to write it down for him.

As the pair check his lungs, Hank tells them he might skip an interview today with a potential family doctor. Kraeker tries to keep it casual.
""Aww, come on,"" he says. ""You have to go.""

Getting there is hard, and Hank is uncertain about the interview process. When he agrees to reschedule, Kraeker is happy.
""It's super important that you get a family doctor,"" he says.

The next stop is in a Park Avenue highrise. The two of them quietly talk directions on the way. To help raise money for HamSmart, Kraeker jokes, ""we could run an Uber service.""



Kraeker gets his trusty medical bag from the trunk, and they head to the eighth floor, where they visit 73-year-old Freddy Devine.
Devine was in prison for 28 years.
""I was in the drug business years ago, in the 70s and 80s,"" he says. ""All I can say is that people got killed and I was responsible.""

In prison, Devine says, he at least had a community. A picture of that community hangs above his living room chair now. Devine with five other men, all of them young, robust and tattooed, wear prison-issue green pants. ""Collins Bay Pen,"" the inscription reads. ""Used Car Salesmen. 3 Block.""
When Devine was released three years ago, the world was different than he remembered — and so was he. He doesn't like being immobile. ""My diabetes is real bad, and I have congestive heart failure,"" he says.
Kraeker and O'Shea, he adds, are ""my whole world now.""



​Back in the car, Kraeker and O'Shea talk about why they do HamSmart, even though it means a pay cut and living out of their cars. They need help too. They hope to find some sponsors. They'd like other health practitioners to join them.
O'Shea thinks about it more after he leaves, and emails his response several hours later.

""I thought a bit about your question of why I enjoy this job,"" he writes.

Doctors are good at identifying illnesses, he says. They're good at telling people to eat well, and exercise, and not smoke.

""What we miss often are the bigger picture items that make and keep people sick. Things like isolation, poverty, homelessness.

""This job gives us the opportunity to see this reality up close and hopefully begin to do something about it.""

His mother, Christina Arulrajah, suspected he had the flu and took him to the doctor.
The visit quickly turned into an ambulance ride to Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children, where a doctor made a shocking diagnosis.
""I was told he had a stroke,"" Arulrajah said, ""at which point I told the doctor, 'No, it's only old people who get strokes.' Sure enough they did an MRI and showed he had a stroke.""

Daniel made a full recovery from the stroke but he soon became a frequent patient at SickKids with a weak immune system and a growing list of painful symptoms: stomach problems, blood in his stool, rashes and infections resulting in sepsis.




""They tested him for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis; it turned out not to be either,"" Arulrajah said.

Years went by and his symptoms became more baffling. Daniel was referred to the hospital's clinical teams specializing in hematology, oncology, rheumatology, immunology, gastroenterology, dermatology and other fields.


The doctors did their best to ease his pain but couldn't provide answers.

""A lot of people saying, 'We are puzzled,'"" the mother said. ""We heard every synonym for the word medical mystery.""

But in a paper published today in Nature Communications, a team of clinician-scientists from SickKids outline how they finally managed to solve the mystery of Daniel's illness using advanced DNA sequencing. The little boy's genome revealed a new disease caused by a never-before-seen gene mutation — one which might also explain the painful health problems of two more SickKids patients.

Dr. Aleixo Muise, a gastroenterologist and one of the leaders of the study, met Daniel seven years ago. In fact, the little boy was one of his first patients at the hospital.
He suspected Daniel had a genetic disorder but he recalls being frustrated because he couldn't figure out which one.
""So we tried to treat him the best as we could, using the drugs that were available, but we knew we were just putting a Band-Aid on his symptoms and not really treating his actual disease.""
In late 2014, Muise and the SickKids team earned a grant for a study of inflammatory bowel disease and similar conditions that would involve sequencing the genomes of select patients. Muise quickly thought of Daniel and enrolled him in the study.

""The big game-changer for Daniel is that we were able to sequence his DNA and from that we were able to identify a mutation of a specific gene that explained all the symptoms that he had,"" Muise said.

Daniel's mutation was in ARPC1B, a gene that produces a core protein of the Arp2/3 complex, which cells need to change shape, divide and perform other important tasks.

When hematologist Dr. Walter Kahr studied Daniel's platelets, he noticed there was no ARPC1B protein. Doctors had previously assumed the protein was essential to survival. 
The co-leader of the study says the ARPC1B protein deficiency explains why Daniel's platelets are small and misshapen. He says normal platelets, which are responsible for clotting blood, resemble fried eggs but Daniel's are spiky.

""It ... explains the fact that the patient had a lot of bleeding problems,"" he said. ""When you have the inflammation, which is part of it, but also if the platelets don't work very well, there's a lot of bleeding. And this patient had a lot of bleeding issues.""


Doctors at SickKids also discovered Daniel isn't their only patient with the disease. They found two other patients with the same mutation and about 20 more cases worldwide. 


Daniel's doctors believe a bone marrow transplant could cure him and they're actively searching for a donor. The 10-year-old is excited about the possibility of putting his health problems behind him.

""It would be really nice because I wouldn't have to go to doctors constantly, it would just be a normal checkup.""",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/illness-sick-kids-hospital-genome-1.4053311?cmp=rss

Saying the government wants to remove financial barriers to a woman's right to choose, Boudreau announced any woman with a valid medicare card will be eligible to receive Mifegymiso at no cost.

The abortion pill can only be obtained by doctor's prescription, and only 24 doctors and pharmacists in New Brunswick have completed or registered for the training required to prescribe and dispense it, respectively, according to the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada.
Boudreau said his statement Tuesday was a ""call-out"" to interested doctors to get the necessary training, so the drug can be offered as soon as possible. 
""As Mifegymiso becomes more widely available throughout the country and New Brunswick, we commit to working with physicians, as well as pharmaceutical distributors, to ensure timely and universal coverage for all New Brunswick women,"" Boudreau said. 
It could take several months before the Health Department gets the program going, because of the need to negotiate the best possible price for the drug, Boudreau said.
The government wants to provide the free coverage up front rather than ask women to pay for it and seek reimbursement. 


The drug, also known as RU-486, went on the market in January, about a year and a half after Health Canada authorized its use for the medical termination of a pregnancy up to 49 days.
""We still feel the safest way to provide for surgical abortions is within the hospitals,"" Boudreau said. ""That's something that when we look now at the three sites it's offered in the province of New Brunswick the feeling is there is enough ... capacity in the system currently,"" said Boudreau.
""The abortion pill is yet another option altogether.""
New Brunswick, which for years had a reputation for low or non-existent access to abortion, is the first province to announce universal coverage for the abortion pill, supporters say.
""Your government has eliminated barriers to reproductive health that were in place for three decades and is committed to doing more,"" Boudreau said in the news release.

Beth Lyons, executive director of the New Brunswick Women's Council, applauded the province's decision to offer universal coverage off Mifegymiso.
""This is really encouraging and a very positive announcement,"" said Lyons.

Although the actual roll-out of the pill has been quite slow across the country, Lyons said New Brunswick is the first province to announce universal coverage such as this.
""We are a province that, on lots of reproductive rights issues, has often been lagging behind other jurisdictions,"" she said.
""And to see us come out to be the first to make a commitment to universal funding is really encouraging.""
Lyons said the New Brunswick Women's Council has known since the drug was approved it would cost roughly $300 to access, which she called ""quite the barrier."" 

As a result, the council advised government to find public funding to cover the drug. 
""This exceeds what we hoped they would come up with,"" she said.  ""We're hopefully setting the standard for access around this, rather than lagging behind.""
Lyons said the policy will be particularly helpful for women in rural communities and those struggling economically, without private coverage for prescription drugs.
""I see this as a real move to make sure that one's financial situation isn't a barrier to exercise their right to choose,"" she said. ""It's an option that any woman or trans [transgender] person could avail themselves of.""

Lyons said there were still concerns about whether physicians and pharmacists in New Brunswick will take the training they need to prescribe the drug.
Before getting a prescription, a woman must have an ultrasound to make sure she is within the window of time the drug label allows for use of the drug.
But timely access to ultrasounds can be a challenge in the province, she said, but Boudreau was optimistic this wouldn't be a problem.

Check if measles vaccinations up to date, Canada's top doctor advises","With the start of summer vacations just a few months away, the country's top doctor is urging Canadians to make sure their measles vaccinations are up to date, especially for those planning to travel overseas.
Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's interim chief medical officer of health, said those whose measles immunizations aren't up to date should be getting their shots six weeks before travelling because the disease continues to circulate in many parts of the world.
""In Europe, there are a number of countries experiencing cases,"" said Tam, calling measles a highly contagious disease that is easily spread.
Romania, for instance, has reported almost 2,000 cases since February 2016. Measles has killed 17 children in the country, none of whom were vaccinated.

Vaccination rates have been falling in some central and eastern European countries, driven in part by an anti-vaccination movement whose messages have been taken up on social media.
Measles is caused by a virus that can rapidly spread through person-to-person contact, via droplets in the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes or by touching objects recently exposed to infected mucus or saliva.
While home-grown cases have been eliminated in Canada — the last domestically acquired case was in 1997 — Canadians who are unvaccinated or under-vaccinated can still contract the disease through infected people who travel into this country, she said Monday.

 That could mean an outbreak of measles if the virus takes hold within an undervaccinated population, as it did in 2015 , when almost 200 cases occurred after an infected visitor introduced the disease into the community.

""The introduction can cause little sparks,"" said Tam. ""If you introduce that spark into a population that's underimmunized, that actually catches fire. It will cause a cluster or an outbreak of cases.""
Tam said there have been 10 confirmed cases of measles in Canada so far this year — all related to travel — and a few suspected cases are under investigation.
Three of those cases, confirmed by Toronto Public Health last month, are connected to  on WestJet or Emirates Airline flights in the last two weeks of March.
""It's important to remember that measles has a long incubation period, up to 21 days, so we're still in the period of time when people who are exposed to these three confirmed cases may come down with measles,"" said Dr. Michael Finkelstein, associate medical officer of health for Toronto.
Initial symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and irritability. Small white spots may also appear inside the mouth and throat. Three to seven days later, a red blotchy rash develops on the face and spreads over the body.

Symptoms begin a week to three weeks after exposure to the virus and a person can spread the infection to others from four days before the rash starts until four days after its disappearance. The virus is most often spread when people first get sick or before they know they have measles.
""We're telling people to watch for signs and symptoms of measles if they were exposed,"" said Finkelstein. ""If they should start to become ill, it's important for them to stay home.""
Those who develop symptoms should seek medical attention, but call ahead before visiting their doctor, medical clinic or hospital emergency department so precautions can be taken to isolate them to prevent transmission to others, he said.
There is no specific treatment for measles and most people recover within two to three weeks. However, measles can be especially dangerous for infants and young children, and those with weakened immune systems.
""About 30 per cent of those who get measles will have some kind of complication, and they range from ear infections to pneumonia to more severe complications such as encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain,"" said Tam. That swelling of the brain can cause seizures, brain damage and even death.

""So it is not a benign disease,"" she said.
The best way to prevent measles is to get inoculated with two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) or measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) immunization. The initial shot is given to a child at 12 to 15 months of age, followed by a second dose between 18 months and four to six years of age.
Adults whose immunizations aren't up to date should receive at least one dose of the vaccine, although two is preferable as some people don't build up antibodies to the virus with a single dose, said Finkelstein.
Tam said having 95 per cent of a given population vaccinated is typically enough to provide protection from infection for those who haven't been immunized because of a phenomenon called """" — which means the virus has difficulty spreading because there are too few hosts left to infect.
In Canada, about 90 per cent of two-year-olds and almost 86 per cent of seven-year-olds had been vaccinated against measles, according to the 2013 childhood National Immunization Coverage Survey.
""So there is a possibility of there being clusters or outbreaks as a result,"" Tam said.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/measles-travel-1.4054351?cmp=rss

It's what they do. It's how they express themselves. And it appears that babies in Canada excel at it.
According to new research from the U.K., babies in Canada, Britain, Italy and the Netherlands cry more than babies in other countries.
 conducted a meta-analysis of studies involving about 8,700 infants in countries including Canada, Germany, Denmark, Japan, Italy and the U.K.

They then calculated the average time babies fuss and cry in their first 12 weeks. On average, babies cry for about two hours a day in the first two weeks. Crying peaked at around two hours and 15 minutes per day at six weeks. The crying gradually decreased to an average of just over one hour at 12 weeks.
On average, Canadian babies cried 30 minutes more than babies from other countries.


Part of the reason for that is the ""colic percentage"" — that is, when a baby cries for more than three hours a day, for more than three days a week. Canadian babies had some of the highest levels (peaking at three to four weeks at 34.1 per cent of infants), followed by the U.K. (peaking at one to two weeks at 28 per cent) and Italy (peaking at eight to nine weeks at 20.9 per cent).
Psychology professor Dieter Wolke, lead author of the study, says Canadian parents need not worry.
""I don't want to concern parents in Canada that this is now a particular problem in Canada — which it isn't,"" he told CBC News. He pointed out that babies in Canada peaked around the three-four week mark but fell into a more normal range around week six.


Germany, Japan and Denmark had the least amount of crying and fussing babies. In fact, researchers found Denmark had consistently lower crying rates across a number of studies.
""In Denmark, it seems to be they're more relaxed about it,"" Wolke said. ""They might have a little bit more support because of maternity and paternity laws ... the father in the first few weeks can stay at home, too."" It's worth noting that Denmark regularly falls at or near the top of the ""best countries to live in"" lists. Wolke speculates that this may foster a population that feels good about itself, and those emotions can transfer to the baby.
""Babies are already very different in how much they cry in the first weeks of life,"" the researchers said. ""There are large but normal variations. We may learn more from looking at cultures where there is less crying and whether this may be due to parenting or other factors relating to pregnancy experiences or genetics.""

In looking at crying patterns in babies worldwide, the British psychologists have created the world's first universal benchmarks for the typical ranges of crying in babies during their first three months.
""Parents had very little idea of how much babies would cry,"" Wolke said. ""They would very often say, 'We were so surprised how it changed our lives and how much a baby cries.'""
""The new chart of normal fuss/cry amounts in babies across industrialized countries will help health professionals to reassure parents whether a baby is crying within the normal, expected range in the first three months or shows excessive crying, which may require further evaluation and extra support for the parents,"" the researchers said.

The treatment has even been described in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ), in  written by Whitehorse General Hospital surgeon Alex Poole and pharmacist Josianne Gauthier.
""We've had a lot of calls from other hospitals in Canada, inquiring about our protocol and how to get access to the drug,"" Gauthier said.
""The drug"" is Iloprost, which is typically used to treat a variety of diseases, by opening vessels to allow blood to flow. When used to treat frostbite, Gauthier says, it can prevent tissue from dying and help it heal.

She says the drug is used in Europe, but it's not commercially available in Canada. That's why the hospital had to apply to Health Canada for special access.
It's been used at Whitehorse General Hospital for about three years now, sometimes in combination with thrombolytics, which treat blood clots.
Poole says the new treatment protocol has been used on eight patients so far. One of those was a runner in the 2015 Arctic Ultra race, who . He kept his digits, though, and returned to Yukon this winter .


""The outcomes have been excellent,"" Poole said.
""We don't anticipate that we'll prevent all amputations — which we've fortunately done so far — but the patients that do require amputations, the goal is they would minimize how much of a finger or toe had to be removed, or if any at all.""

Poole says the Whitehorse hospital developed the treatment after analyzing the cases that it was dealing with — about 10 per year, he says, with two or three of those cases being severe.
""And thus no one person had a lot of experience treating these patients. And once we decided to collect them all, we recognized that there was probably an opportunity to do it better than we were doing,"" Poole said. 
They began talking to experts and doing their own research.

""We didn't really re-invent anything, we more or less gathered what we thought was the best way of doing it, and implement[ed] it at the Whitehorse hospital,"" Poole said.
Now Gauthier says other hospitals, including Yellowknife's Stanton Territorial Hospital, are requesting similar access to Iloprost. She hopes the Whitehorse treatment protocol will become more common across Canada.
For Poole, a self-described ""country surgeon,"" it shows that even small hospitals can do big things.
""I think it encourages you that if there are particular conditions you deal with that may not be as common in larger centres, you can impact how that care is done across the country,"" he said.
""I think it is a bit of a feather in Whitehorse General's cap.""",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-frostbite-treatment-protocol-cmaj-1.4053851?cmp=rss

The lawsuit was filed on Monday in Tacoma, Washington, federal court by three EpiPen purchasers. It claims Mylan engaged in a scheme with pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs — companies that act as intermediaries between pharmacies, insurers, and drug companies — to dominate the market and overcharge consumers.

Although other lawsuits have been filed over EpiPen pricing, Monday's is the first to focus on the role of PBMs and to bring claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a federal law historically used against organized crime.
Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin declined to comment.

The EpiPen, acquired by Mylan in 2007, is a hand-held device that treats life-threatening allergic reactions by automatically injecting a dose of epinephrine. The company now sells a .
The plaintiffs in Monday's lawsuit say Mylan paid large rebates to PBMs so they would favor EpiPen over competitors. In helping Mylan control 95 per cent of the epinephrine auto-injector market, the rebates artificially inflated EpiPen's sticker price, resulting in higher costs for many patients, the suit said.

The lawsuit says the three largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers — CVS Caremark, part of CVS Health; Express Scripts Holding Co and OptumRX, part of UnitedHealth Group Inc — aided Mylan's alleged scheme. They were not named as defendants.
The plaintiffs are seeking damages to represent a nationwide class of EpiPen purchasers. Mylan has grappled with a growing backlash from U.S. consumers over the price of EpiPen in the last year. Other class action lawsuits have been filed against Mylan over the pricing of EpiPen, including two currently consolidated in Kansas federal court. However, they have not focused on the role of PBMs.

The company is also under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and said last September that it had agreed to a  with the U.S. Justice Department over how the drug was classified for government buyers. The Justice Department has not confirmed the settlement.

Mylan Chief Executive Officer Heather Bresch has said that the company makes only about $100 per EpiPen pack, and that most consumers pay less than $50 for a two-pack.
The plaintiffs in Monday's lawsuit said Bresch falsely tried to paint Mylan as a ""victim"" of a flawed healthcare system and avoid its own responsibility in setting rebates.

By halting assistance to the UN Population Fund, the Trump administration is following through on promises to let socially conservative policies that President Donald Trump embraced in his campaign determine the way the U.S. government operates and conducts itself in the world. Though focused on forced abortion — a concept opposed by liberals and conservatives alike — the move to invoke the ""Kemp-Kasten amendment"" was sure to be perceived as a gesture to anti-abortion advocates and other conservative interests.
The UN fund will lose $32.5 million US in funding from the 2017 budget, the State Department said, with funds shifted to similar programs at the U.S. Agency for International Development. It wasn't immediately clear whether the UN fund would also lose out on tens of millions of additional dollars it has typically received from the U.S. in ""non-core"" funds.
Under a three-decade-old law, the U.S. is barred from funding organizations that aid or participate in forced abortion of involuntary sterilization. It's up to each administration to determine which organizations meet that condition. The UN Population Fund has typically been cut off during Republican administrations and had its funding resumed when Democrats control the White House.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee was notified of the move by the State Department in a letter received Monday. The letter followed a formal designation by Tom Shannon, the State Department's undersecretary of political affairs, that said the fund ""supports, or participates in the management of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.""
In a lengthy memorandum obtained by The Associated Press, the State Department said the UN fund partners with China's National Health and Family Planning Commission, responsible for overseeing China's ""two-child policy"" — a loosened version of the notorious ""one-child policy"" in place from 1979 to 2015. It said the UN collaborates with the Chinese agency on family planning. Still, the memo acknowledged there was no evidence of UN support for forced abortions or sterilization in China.
The UN Population Fund, known as UNFPA, said it regretted the U.S. move and argued it was ""erroneous"" to suggest it was complicit in China's policies.
""UNFPA refutes this claim, as all of its work promotes the human rights of individuals and couples to make their own decisions, free of coercion or discrimination,"" the agency said in a statement.

The designation was the latest move by the Trump administration to prioritize traditionally conservative issues in the federal budget. The Trump administration has vowed to cut all dollars for climate change programming, and also restored the so-called global gag rule, which prohibits funding to non-governmental groups that support even voluntary abortions.
The Trump administration has also signalled that it no longer sees a need for the U.S. to so generously fund UN and other international organizations. The White House has proposed cutting roughly one-third from the State Department's budget, with much of it expected to come from foreign aid and global organization dollars, although Congress is expected to restore at least some of that funding
The UN agency's mission involves promoting universal access to family planning and reproductive health, with a goal of reducing maternal deaths and practices like female genital mutilation. The cut-off funds will be ""reprogrammed"" to USAID's Global Health Programs account to focus on similar issues, said a State Department official, who wasn't authorized to comment by name and requested anonymity.
The Kemp-Kasten amendment, enacted in 1985, led to some of the UN agency's funding being initially cut off, then restored by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1993, USAID said in a report. Republican George W. Bush's administration reversed the decision in 2002, but President Barack Obama — a Democrat — gave the funding back after taking office.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/trump-united-nations-population-fund-1.4054113?cmp=rss
7abc5edee951231e3c9556c9fcebd6f0fbe2efbb,Lauren Pelley,2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,'A wake-up call': Study indicates where you live in Ontario factors into heart attack risk,"Where you live in Ontario could have a lot to do with your risk of having a heart attack or stroke, a massive new study has found.
The peer-reviewed research,  in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, hammered home the stark divide in health outcomes throughout the province. It found people in northern Ontario faced nearly double the levels of cardiovascular health issues compared to residents in and around Toronto, and one clinician is calling the results a ""wake-up call.""

Researchers tracked 5.5 million middle-aged adults from 2008 to 2012, looking for heart attacks, strokes and deaths from cardiovascular issues. None of the adults — all between 40 and 79 — had a history of cardiovascular disease.
""What we found were rather striking two-fold differences in the incidence of cardiovascular disease between Ontarians living in different parts of the province,"" said lead author Dr. Jack Tu, a senior scientist at the Toronto-based Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences.
Tu, who's also a cardiologist at Sunnybrook's Schulich Heart Centre and was an expert adviser for CBC's , has long studied regional variations in cardiovascular deaths.
His latest ""big data"" study with the Cardiovascular Health in Ambulatory Care Research Team included data from various health-care databases maintained by Ontario government, and broke information down by Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs).

The research found the healthiest three LHINs were all in the Greater Toronto Area, with the Mississauga Halton LHIN, Toronto Central LHIN and Central LHIN coming out on top.
Those three had the fewest cardiovascular health issues during the study period, with 3.2 to 3.5 events out of every 1,000 person-years — a statistical measurement used to express incidence rates.
The four least-healthy LHINs were the North East LHIN and North West LHIN — both in northern Ontario — along with the North Simcoe Muskoka LHIN and Erie St. Clair LHIN.

Those areas were found to have the most cardiovascular health issues, with 4.8 to 5.7 events out of every 1,000 person-years — or roughly double those of the most healthy LHINs.
""Those living in the areas with the lowest burden of disease were the most likely to have received cardiovascular preventative services — such as having an annual physical, seeing their doctor to have their cholesterol and diabetes checked, and having their blood pressure controlled,"" noted Tu.
In contrast, people in the least-healthy areas were less likely to receive preventive screening tests or have an annual physician, and also visited a family doctor less often. They were also more likely to be obese or smoke, and have the lowest intake of fruits and vegetables.

The researchers determined improving access to preventive health-care services could boost cardiovascular health.
Tu said his team account for the many other factors that contributed to each person's health, such as their ethnic background or whether they were immigrants.

By using a statistical analysis method to make predictions, the researchers determined that factors within Ontario's health system, such as access to preventive health care, account for roughly 15 per cent of the difference in health levels between different regions.
""The data suggests that there's a significant number of Ontarians who are not being fully assessed for cardiovascular risk in the middle-age range,"" Tu said.

Toronto emergency room physician Dr. Brett Belchetz agreed, and praised the research for its ""incredible size"" and the length of the followup time.
""The disparity here is obviously far greater than I ever would've expected. The outcomes are far worse for rural areas than I ever would've expected. I think it's a wake-up call for all of us in the province that we have a bigger problem on our hands than we realized,"" said Belchetz, who was not involved in the research.

Belchetz said it has long been known that access to care is trickier in rural communities, thanks to reduced access to lab testing and a lower physician-to-patient ratio. Increased access to doctors, screening, and better education are all key to reducing the health divide, he said.
""The fact that we're seeing rates of these types of illnesses that are almost double in rural areas than they are in cities — that's something that's unacceptable,"" he added.
Tu acknowledged there were limitations to the research, which was funded primarily by an operating grant from the Institute of Circulatory and Respiratory Health-Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
There was a lack of complete data for every health indicator used for the millions of people in the study, for instance, and the team also couldn't be 100 per cent sure of a causal relationship between various risk factors and someone having a cardiovascular issue.
But he still stressed the importance of patients taking their health care into their own hands by getting fully assessed and screened — wherever they live — and said policymakers need to consider geography when they're determining health-care policies.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-cardio-health-study-1.4051936?cmp=rss

It started with a single case of food poisoning last November. Then five more cases appeared in a single week later that month. Throughout December there were two new cases every week. By mid-January an unmistakable pattern had emerged. And that's when the Public Health Agency of Canada made its first public announcement that an unusual strain of E.coli was causing a sporadic pattern of infections in Western Canada and in Newfoundland.  
The  received almost no publicity. Neither did the four updates that followed every few weeks after that. By the end of March, 25 people had been infected with E. coli O121.  Six were hospitalized.
Finally this week  they'd found a suspected source of the contamination — uncooked flour. One infection has been definitively linked to a  of Robin Hood flour distributed by a Smucker Foods of Canada facility in Saskatoon, Sask.

Officials made the link because the sick person still had some of the flour at home, which tested positive for E.coli O121. The remaining 24 cases have the identical bacterial fingerprint. And PHAC says some of those people also report having contact with Robin Hood flour. PHAC said it's possible that additional products will be linked to the outbreak.
This is the first multi-provincial outbreak of E.coli O121 in Canada.
University of Guelph food pathogen researcher Keith Warriner said the key question now is whether this is an isolated contamination or if it's the beginning of what could become a chronic risk with flour. In other words, should we approach flour with the same care that we handle undercooked meat?
Last year 63 people in 24 states in the U.S.  after exposure to two dangerous E.coli strains in uncooked flour from General Mills. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told CBC News there is no evidence linking the two outbreaks.
Warriner said these flour-related strains of E.coli are called ""non-O157 E.coli"" to distinguish them from the hamburger bug we're used to hearing about (E.coli O157:H7). For years the non-O157 E. coli were considered curious but not dangerous.
Now, Warriner said, they're becoming increasingly virulent and seem to be specially adapted to contaminate vegetables and other produce, along with water, and now flour. Like the hamburger bug, they produce a Shiga toxin that can damage human kidneys, leaving some victims needing lifelong dialysis.
How does flour become contaminated with E.coli? Warriner said it could happen in the wheat fields, where both animal and human waste is used as fertilizer. Because flour is usually cooked before eating, any bacteria are killed.
The bottom line is that people shouldn't lick the cake batter spoons and they should avoid eating raw cookie dough.


It's a fundamental principle in science — research findings must be reproducible. But there's  that much of the scientific literature can't be reproduced. Some researchers suspect part of the problem could be in the research methods.
Back in 2012, a  revealed that the number of U.S. psychologists admitting to questionable research practices was ""surprisingly high.""
When an Italian group gave the same survey to a group of Italian research psychologists they  that most also admitted to using controversial techniques, including the frowned-upon practice of declaring that a surprise finding was something they had predicted from the beginning.
Other questionable practices included:

Only a fraction of the scientists admitted to the outright falsification of data.
The Italian researchers trace the current confidence crisis in science to a  concluding that over half of the published research results are false because of bias and research flaws.


How to close the back door on hospital gowns? It's more challenging than it might seem. That's what a group of medical and design students in Halifax have discovered.
""We began to realize how difficult it was to balance what clinicians need and what patients would like,"" Saif Syed told CBC News.

Their current ideas include gowns that can be adjusted depending on the need, made longer or shorter, or closing at the front instead of the back. They're also trying to replace the fasteners with silicon clasps that can be squeezed shut, because patients with arthritis have trouble tying existing gowns.
They're also testing a variety of cotton and linen fabrics, and toying with colour options. Syed said he believes there's more than just comfort at stake. He thinks it could improve patient outcomes, noting that there's evidence that hospital patients feel additional disorientation because they're wearing unfamiliar clothes.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/second-opinion-1.4050626?cmp=rss

The lawyer for Dr. Sarah Dawn Jones argued Monday in Bridgewater provincial court that information his client gave to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Nova Scotia should be excluded.
Stan MacDonald also objected to the Crown introducing a medication drop box from the Crossroads Family Practice in the Halifax suburb of Tantallon, where Jones worked.
MacDonald argued using the evidence would violate Jones's charter rights against self-incrimination.

When charges were laid around a year ago, Bridgewater police alleged that Jones wrote the prescriptions for oxycodone and Oxyneo pills over a one-year period.

MacDonald said Monday the province's Medical Act compelled Jones to provide the evidence to the college, which temporarily suspended her licence to practise in August 2015 after a pharmacist reported unusual activity to the college's investigative branch.

The college contacted Jones to discuss allegations she was diverting drugs and reported the matter to police. In response to the college's investigation, Jones wrote a 16-page letter outlining her treatment of a patient and also gave oral testimony.
MacDonald argued police only became aware of the potential importance of the medication drop box and its inventory of contents through the college's investigation. 
He said the Crown's theory that Jones had obtained and diverted pills was partly based on the evidence obtained from the college. MacDonald said Jones had informed the committee there were medications in the drop box.
""When the box was seized, there was no narcotics returned [in it] ... and the Crown says, 'Well, that's incriminating because Dr. Jones told the college she returned them [the narcotics] to that box,""' said MacDonald.

The Crown, however, argued police would have come across the drop box during the normal course of their investigation. 
Jones has pleaded not guilty to charges including possession of narcotics for the purpose of trafficking, drawing a document without authority and fraud. Charges of theft and breach of trust were dropped last year.
The college said Jones remains under an interim suspension.
Judge Timothy Landry has reserved his decision on the charter arguments until Friday, at which time lawyers will also discuss scheduling the remainder of the trial.

But minutes later, when a midwife began to explain over the phone how to deliver the baby, he said: ""Are you serious?""

""I'm just a regular guy,"" says the 33-year-old lawyer who successfully delivered the couple's first child, Dari, now 3½, one Saturday afternoon in the couple's London, Ont., home. 

""I could see the head, and after two pushes, he was out.""


After a rub on the back, the baby began breathing. The midwives arrived a few minutes later. 
""It felt like a really long time but it was only a few seconds,"" says Ibukun, also 33.




While many home births are planned, some are not. It's not uncommon for 911 dispatchers to receive emergency calls and hear ""it's coming"" on the other end of the phone. In those instances, they can coach others through the steps of delivery before paramedics or other medical professionals are available to take over.

Occasionally, paramedics arrive to find a baby has just been born, delivered by bystanders with little to no training.

Known as ""born before arrival,"" emergency childbirth is rare.


While statistics on frequency of such births are not tracked nationally in Canada, only one in 200 babies born in the U.K. arrives suddenly, almost always to women who have previously had short labours. 

In Ontario last year, the Ministry of Health says there were 3,039 calls to 911 in connection with an imminent childbirth or labour.


When babies do come quickly, ""most of the time, they just fall out,"" says midwife Melissa Coubrough, who practises in London, Ont. 

Coubrough and her colleague Emily Eby, a midwife in Collingwood, Ont., account for such a possibly in the birth plan of women who are known to have ""precipitous deliveries,"" they say. 

""At 37 weeks, we have a chat. If the baby is coming quickly, here's what you need to know,"" says Eby. 



The first step is to phone for help. ""Call 911 and then call your midwife,"" says Eby. Both 911 dispatchers and midwives are trained to coach a bystander through a delivery over the phone.

Medical communications officer Shannon Kosick, who works for Emergency Health Services in Nova Scotia, agrees. 

""Let us come to you,"" she says. 


After 17 years working on ambulances as an advanced care paramedic, Kosick has been a 911 dispatcher for the last six years after a back injury meant she couldn't ""work the streets.""

Delivering a baby over the phone ""is a completely different experience,"" says Kosick, who delivered four babies in her 17 years working on ambulances and has been involved in several deliveries through her headset.

""You have to go by what people tell you and what you hear in the room,"" she says.

""Panic is contagious, but so is calm,"" she says, adding that dispatchers are trained to use ""repetitive persistence"" with phrases like ""I need you to be calm in order to assist you.""



Eby and Coubrough advise removing the woman's lower clothing and having her lie flat. 

""That way, if the baby comes out, it doesn't have anywhere to fall,"" says Eby. 

Dispatchers will direct the person on the phone to collect plenty of dry towels or blankets to keep the baby warm once it is born.



After consulting your midwife or obstetrician to confirm that labour has begun, panting can slow the progression of the baby while midwives or paramedics respond.

""If you have an uncontrollable urge to push, stop and have a look to see if the baby is crowning,"" says Eby. 

Crowning is the medical term for the head exiting the vagina. 


""It feels like a ring of fire and you'll feel like you need to have a bowel movement,"" she adds.

If the baby is crowning, Eby advises to stay put — the baby could be moments from being born. 

At that point, dispatchers will instruct the caller to ""place the palm of your hand against her vagina and apply firm but gentle pressure to keep the baby's head from delivering too fast and tearing her,"" according to the script dispatchers follow.



As the baby is born, support its head and shoulders. The baby will be slippery and should be handled with a firm grip. Don't pull on the baby, but rather let the mom's pushes bring the baby out naturally, says the script. 

""Let the mom do all the work,"" says Kosick.



Once the baby is born, use towels or clean clothing to dry and stimulate it. It should be crying — if not, you may need to provide mouth-to-mouth breaths or CPR. Dispatchers can coach you through that, too, says Kosick. 

Place the baby skin to skin on the mom's chest and cover it with a blanket.

""Breastfeeding is good for both mom and baby,"" says Coubrough.

The professionals say that tying or cutting the umbilical cord can wait, and that the delivery of the placenta — often called the afterbirth — will happen naturally without any need for pulling or tugging on the cord.


The cord can be cut later by paramedics or midwives. If they'll be a while, dispatchers will explain how to tie off the cord before cutting it.

""It may seem like a long time, but help will be there in a flash,"" says Eby. 

""Just be present for the moment,"" says Coubrough. ""Childbirth is a beautiful thing.""


Kosick remembers the last delivery she assisted over the phone. 

""Afterwards, people were crying. The women were crying, the men were crying, everyone was crying. Bringing a new human into the world is really great.


""People who call 911 are usually having a bad day. But that was a very good day,"" she says. 

Kosick recalls the last phrase written in her script before the paramedics arrive and take over:
""Is it a boy or a girl? Then I disconnect,"" she says.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/babies-coming-quickly-delivery-bystanders-1.4036821?cmp=rss

Pfizer Canada issued a statement late Friday night saying it has decided to .
""In Canada, the recall impacts one lot (5GU763) of the 0.3 mg strength of EpiPen Auto-Injector expiring in May 2017 and one lot (5GR765) of the 0.15 mg strength of EpiPen Jr Auto-Injector expiring in March 2017,"" said the company, which distributes the product, manufactured by Meridian Medical Technologies in the U.S.
The products in lot 5GU763 were distributed by Pfizer Canada from January to March 2016. Those in lot 5GR765 were distributed from November 2015 to February 2016.
Pfizer said it's committed to replacing the recalled devices at no cost and has advised consumers who have them to contact its information line at 1-800-463-6001.

9ee1331372d643f1a6126e601947d5f4c38b3296,The Canadian Press,2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,Ottawa tries again with natural health product consultation,"Health Canada is launching a second set of public consultations about a controversial plan to revamp regulations governing self-care products such as natural health remedies, cosmetics and over-the-counter medications.
Public meetings to gather consumer and industry input about the proposed changes will begin on Wednesday in Saskatoon and continue in cities across the country for the next three months, said Manon Bombardier, director-general of the department's Natural and Non-Prescription Health Products Directorate.
The Canada-wide consultation process follows a web-based gathering of opinion last fall that heard from more than 3,500 respondents, including consumers, industry representatives, health providers and public interest groups.
Much of the feedback was negative — with proponents of natural health products, in particular, expressing concerns over the suggested retooling — prompting Health Canada to develop ""refined"" proposals and take the consultation initiative on the road.

The proposed framework is meant to modernize the way self-care products and non-prescription drugs are regulated, Bombardier said, noting that some of the rules were first enacted decades ago.
""We want to ensure that Canadians continue to have access to a wide range of products that are safe and effective and can enter the market on a timely basis,"" she said from Ottawa. ""We want the evaluation or pre-market assessment to be based on risk.""
Self-care products considered moderate- or high-risk — such as a new non-prescription pain killer — would require a government review, based on science-based evidence that supports the manufacturer's health claims.

Lower-risk products — including vitamins, homeopathic remedies and herbal medicines with a long history of use — would not be reviewed by Health Canada. However, they would no longer be able to make claims about prevention or treatment of a particular health condition, such as ""relieves back pain.""
""Health Canada is of the view that self-care products in general are lower risk and therefore will not be treated [like] prescription drugs,"" Bombardier said.
Currently, a product such as toothpaste may fall under three different categories and sets of regulations.

A flavoured product that just cleans the teeth is considered cosmetic, while one that contains fluoride would be regulated as a natural health product. But a toothpaste containing a whitener like hydrogen peroxide is classified as a drug and therefore subject to strict requirements to prove safety and effectiveness, including data from patient trials. Health Canada can recall such products if they are found not to meet those standards.
""So there are very different standards for very similar-looking products,"" said Bombardier. ""What we're trying to do is make the system more consistent, more fair and more easy to understand for consumers, so that when they go shopping and have a variety of options in front of them, they can make an informed choice.""

The overhaul of self-care product regulations, put forward last fall, was met with opposition from many consumers, producers and retailers of natural health products, among them the Canadian Health Food Association (CHFA).
The trade association, which represents manufacturers, distributors and retailers of natural and organic health products, expressed concern that if adopted, the proposed changes would limit government oversight for some natural health products, reduce information on their labels and boost their cost. Some products might disappear from the market, while development of new products could be curtailed, the organization argued.

The organization is now taking a wait-and-see attitude, said CHFA president Helen Long.
""The initial proposal back in the fall lacked clarity and details, and we were concerned it could have negative implications for the 79 per cent of Canadians that are using natural health products,"" Long said on Friday.
""Once the next round of consultations actually begins, I expect that we we'll get a bit more of a glimpse into where they're proposing to go next."" ",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/health-canada-products-1.4050629?cmp=rss

WestJet says a flight crew member was recently diagnosed with the measles virus and may have exposed passengers to the illness on several flights.
In a statement Friday, the airline said staff have begun contacting guests from the affected flights to let them know of the possible exposure.
The following flights are affected:

Anyone on these flights who develops a fever or cold-like symptoms should contact a doctor. 
On Thursday,  issued a health warning, saying it was investigating three confirmed cases of the measles in the city.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said on Friday the $100 million US trial has already been funded and will proceed, irrespective of the $7 billion in cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget proposed by the Trump Administration over the next 18 months.
In a conference call with reporters, Fauci would not comment on the proposed cuts because it is not clear yet what the actual budget will be. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers oppose cuts to the NIH, which funds 21 institutes, including NIAID.
NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins is scheduled to speak with U.S. President Donald Trump later on Friday. ""I will certainly be talking to Francis Collins when he returns from the White House,"" Fauci said.

Zika typically causes mild symptoms, but when the virus infects a pregnant women, she can pass it to her fetus, causing a variety of birth defects including microcephaly, in which the baby's head is abnormally small.
Fauci said the current Zika vaccine candidate had cleared preliminary safety hurdles, and would now enter testing for efficacy, which would occur in two phases.
The first phase will continue testing for safety and evaluate the vaccine's ability to stimulate the immune system to develop antibodies to fight Zika. It will also test different doses to see which works best.
The second phase, set to begin in June, will attempt to determine if the vaccine can actually prevent Zika infection.

Several companies are developing Zika vaccines, including Sanofi SA, GlaxoSmithKline and Takeda Pharmaceuticals.
In the NIAID study, researchers aim to enroll at least 2,490 healthy volunteers in areas with confirmed or potential active transmission of Zika by mosquitoes. These include parts of the continental United States, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Peru, Costa Rica, Panama and Mexico. They will receive either the vaccine, or a placebo, and be followed for two years.
If enough people are exposed to the virus, Fauci said they could get an effectiveness signal as early as the end of this year. The trial is expected to be completed by 2019.

Fauci said the government is already in discussions with pharmaceutical companies that would share the costs of the final stage of testing and handle manufacturing.
Zika is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, but it can also be transmitted sexually. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5,182 people in the continental United States have been infected by Zika either locally or through travel to places where the virus is spreading. Another 38,303 cases have been reported in U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico. ",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/zika-vaccine-testing-1.4050392?cmp=rss

Research from the University of Guelph indicates Canadians aged between 40 and 59 are less likely to use condoms than their younger counterparts.
The study found 65 per cent of men in that age bracket surveyed online reported not using a condom the last time they had sex, while the number jumped to 72 per cent for women.

The number included respondents who were married, divorced, single or widowed.
The research findings were released Thursday in the .
Study co-author Robin Milhausen says it's not unusual to see people exercise less caution as they age.

""The longer you are alive and sexually active and have no negative outcomes … eventually safer sex fatigue can set in where you just think 'it won't happen to me' and you stop using it,"" she said in a telephone interview.
Safe-sex education and outreach efforts can easily target high school and university students who congregate in common places, but have a harder time reaching older populations that are more widely dispersed, she said.

Milhausen said there are numerous reasons for the decrease in condom use, many of which are strikingly logical.
Fear of erectile dysfunction and performance anxiety can also play a role among older men, she said, adding many may choose to avoid condom use for fear it will exacerbate existing issues they may be contending with.
But relationship status plays a major role as well, she said.
Canadians re-entering the dating scene after a marriage or long-term relationship may feel reluctant to use condoms or have safe-sex-related conversations with prospective partners, she said.
For those who are not dating casually and are pursuing more committed relationships, the risk becomes even greater.
""Love, trust and intimacy are the death blows to condom use,"" she said. ""The more committed you feel ... the less likely you are to use a condom, but love and trust don't protect you against chlamydia.""
The research suggested middle-aged respondents had a surprisingly cavalier attitude towards sexually transmitted infections (STI), with 58 per cent saying they were either not very or not at all concerned about contracting one.
Milhausen said numerous other research papers indicate STI rates are actually on the rise almost across the board among older demographics, suggesting the need for greater vigilance and condom use.
She urged Canadians who have not used condoms since their younger days to revisit the idea, adding they might be pleasantly surprised.
""For this mid-life group, condoms are way different than they were when this age group was trying them at 20 years old,"" she said. ""In 30 years, we've come a long way.""
About 2,400 adults took part in the online survey.

""Now that I'm married, they want to evict me. I will no longer be considered a Mohawk of Kahnawake. That is super, super devastating,"" Deer told CBC Montreal's new podcast Montreapolis in a wide-ranging interview.
Deer got married last fall.

She and her husband, who is non-Indigenous, are among 20 families that have received eviction notices as part of the Kahnawake Mohawk Council's longstanding and controversial law that bars mixed-race couples from living on the territory.

Deer has helped put Kahnawake on the map with her successful dramedy series , which delves into the struggles and sex lives of four young women living there. 
The show is filmed on the territory and features several local actors.
, produced by Rezolution Pictures, has been nominated for several Canadian Screen Awards over its four seasons. A fifth and final season should begin filming later this year.  

The series is lighthearted in tone, but it doesn't shy away from controversial issues, including Kahnawake's residency law.
Deer said while she has several fans in Kahnawake, reaction to the show there isn't always positive.
""There are definitely those people here who hate it and think I'm a traitor and that I'm making us look terrible,"" Deer said.


Deer and her husband live in a house she owns on the reserve, right next to the house she grew up in, where her mother still lives.
She keeps a small office in the basement where she works on her film and TV projects.

Growing up, Deer's parents never explicitly told her she had to marry a Mohawk man, but she said it was an unspoken assumption in the community that Mohawk women had to marry Mohawk men and have Mohawk babies.  

She did end up marrying a Mohawk, whom she later divorced.  
After that, she decided to expand her search for love beyond Kahnawake. She met her current husband through a matchmaking service.

The residency law has been on the books in Kahnawake since 1981. The band council says the purpose of the law is to help preserve the Mohawk nation and keep the community alive.  
The council is currently reviewing the law, and an updated draft should be released soon. But there seems to be no question of softening it. 
In an open letter published in February, the council said the new law will ""address the challenge of enforcement.""

The council also sent out a new round of letters to mixed-marriage couples living on the reserve in February, asking them to make arrangements to vacate the territory.
""If you have not yet done so, we ask that you take the letter seriously and govern yourselves accordingly, as the next action step will be implemented on May 1, 2017,"" the letter reads.  
It's not clear what that ""action step"" will consist of.


Deer was forced to leave Kahnawake due to circumstances beyond her control once before, during the 1990 Oka crisis, when she was just 12.  
She and her mother and sister were part of a convoy of women, children and elderly people who were evacuated from the reserve over safety concerns.  
The Mohawks in that convoy were jeered and pelted with rocks by an angry mob of non-Indigenous protesters on the Montreal side of the Mercier Bridge. It was a shattering experience, she said.


Now, it's Deer's own people who are judging her.
Deer and her husband oppose the law and would like to fight it, but her husband has a son who lives with them, and they're thinking of having children together.  
She said she doesn't want her children to face the same identity struggles she faced during the Oka crisis.
Deer said the family already has a home off-reserve and will move there if necessary, for the sake of the children.
""I'm not going to put them through that. They're not going to grow up being told that they're not important because I love their father,"" Deer said, her eyes welling with tears.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/tracey-deer-creator-of-mohawk-girls-facing-eviction-from-her-native-kahnawake-where-show-is-set-1.3991142?cmp=rss

Pallister says he was approached late last year by a site locator who wanted to use his waterfront home for the horror movie , which has been filming in different areas of Winnipeg.
The film is the seventh in the  franchise, which focuses on a doll that is possessed by the spirit of a serial killer.

Pallister's home is among the biggest in Winnipeg — a 9,000-square-foot mansion valued at more than $2 million.  
The premier says it would have been fun to see his house on the big screen.
But he and his family did not want the home to be opened up to a movie crew.
""The idea of my wife and children and I making it up the carpet at the Academy Awards to see our home on display ... would have been great, but unfortunately we just weren't able to offer up our home,"" Pallister said Tuesday.

Pallister praised the number of Manitoba locations that have appeared in Hollywood movies, including the provincial legislature, which was seen in the 2005 movie starring Philip Seymour Hoffman.
But he appeared to have his tongue in cheek when talking about the franchise, which has never been nominated for an Academy Award.
He called the offer a chance to ""get involved in an ostensibly fabulous Hollywood production of fine quality.""  
""I tell you, those Chucky films get better and better. The more they produce, the better they get.""

But just as suddenly as it appeared, it recently disappeared — painted over in error as part of an attempt to crack down on graffiti on campus.
That didn't sit well with some members of the campus community and plans are now underway to restore the poem, known as ""Leon the Frog.""

Ian Kinney is part of that effort.
As a former U of C student, he restored portions of the poem once before — about 10 years ago — but the recent elimination of the entire poem is a first. 
""When I first learned of [the removal], I was shocked,"" Kinney told the . ""I didn't know anyone could remove 'Leon the Frog' without recognizing just what this poem was.""
As soon as the poem was erased, university students and faculty started figuring out a way to bring it back.
""The faculty of arts immediately recognized what had happened when it had happened and they were very apologetic,"" said Kinney. 
He's rounding up  to participate in the restoration event on April 13.
""The tale of 'Leon the Frog' is a charming staple of the University of Calgary's history and it's been dear to social sciences, humanities, communications and fine arts students for decades,"" Richard Sigurdson, dean of the faculty of arts, said in a statement. ""It's important to the faculty of arts that this work of public art be restored.""

'Leon the Frog' has been touched up multiple times in the past, with students taking markers to the stairwell to rewrite the words — and sometimes add their own.
That makes it difficult to credit an original creator, Kinney said.
""I don't think that there really is a first poet,"" he said. ""This is something that we continue to collaborate on.""",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/university-calgary-leon-frog-poem-1.4054659?cmp=rss

Superior Court Judge Scott M. Gordon refused to address how Polanski would be sentenced if he returned to the U.S. after 40 years abroad. He noted that other courts, including a California appellate court, have ruled that the Oscar winner is a fugitive and must return to Los Angeles for sentencing.
""There is no sufficient or compelling basis for reconsideration of these issues,"" Gordon wrote.
Polanski was charged with six felonies in 1977 after he was accused of plying a 13-year-old girl with champagne and part of a sedative pill, then raping her at actor Jack Nicholson's house.
Polanski pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor, but he fled Los Angeles on the eve of sentencing in 1978. He has sought to resolve the case several times without personally appearing in court.
His travel has since been confined to three countries: his native France, Switzerland and Poland, where he fled the Holocaust.

The victim has said she forgives the director and believes the case should end.
Polanski, 83, has long contended that he is the victim of judicial misconduct because a now-deceased judge who handled the case suggested in private remarks that he would renege on a plea bargain and sentencing agreement. It called for no more time behind bars for the director after he spent 42 days in a prison undergoing a diagnostic screening.
Polanski's lawyer, Harland Braun, said Gordon's order failed to address what he called the central issue in the case — misconduct by several previous judges who handled the case.

Polanski contends emails show that several judges had discussed how Polanski had to return to Los Angeles for sentencing.
""It seems like this just another coverup,"" Braun said in an interview.
He said his efforts were aimed at seeing if the judicial system could fix previous errors in the case, and whether it was ""capable of healing itself.""
""In that regard, Judge Gordon proved that he cannot,"" Braun said.
Gordon's ruling says Polanski and Braun had ""not presented sufficient credible, admissible evidence or legal arguments to warrant the requested relief.""
Previous rulings have stated that the only way Polanski can address his allegations is to return to Los Angeles for his sentencing hearing. That would likely involve him being arrested and serving additional time behind bars while he awaited a hearing.
Braun has said Polanski's confinement in jail and house arrest in Switzerland during a failed extradition effort in 2009 and 2010 meant the director has already served his sentence.
The ruling came two weeks after Gordon convened a hearing to address several requests by Polanski's lawyer. Los Angeles prosecutors, who declined to comment on Monday's ruling, vehemently opposed any ruling that would end the case without Polanski's appearance in court.
Deputy District Attorney Michele Hanisee said Polanski was asking Gordon to give a ""wealthy celebrity different treatment than any other fugitive.""

Production volume for the past year sits around $127 million, according to Manitoba Film and Music.
That's 27 per cent better than the annual average, and it's a trend Manitoba Film and Music's CEO expects to continue.
""I would say this is the best province in the country to be shooting in,"" said Carole Vivier. ""We have the best tax credit in Canada. The reason for that is, we don't have a direct flight to Los Angeles. We don't have direct flights to New York.  We are a smaller centre so we have to work harder and be more competitive than anyone else to stay on that map.""
Other provinces have rolled back tax credits for film productions in recent years, and some have put caps on the amount productions can claim.
Nova Scotia replaced their tax credit with a film and television incentive fund, .

Last spring,  from 33 per cent to 28 per cent.
Even Saskatchewan scrapped its credit, and .

Right now, in Manitoba, an estimated 1,600 people are employed in the industry, with a big jump in the number of people employed in the animation sector.

Over the past 10 years, there has been more than $1 billion in production, with about half of that staying in the province, according to Vivier.
""That's in people paying their taxes here — all the crews that are working here, this is all Manitoba. They all pay taxes here. It's the suppliers, it's the restaurants, it's the car rentals, it's legal, hotels — it all stays here,"" said Vivier.
2017 started with filming of five features, including , staring Stanley Tucci and Henry Cavill and the Keanu Reeves thriller .
Meanwhile, NBC's series  returned to Manitoba to film its third season.

Last week, home-grown producer Meghan Duffy wrapped up shooting on her first feature film, .
Duffy runs Black Watch Entertainment, a Winnipeg-based production company. She said it's not only the tax credit that's helping bring in business but also the low Canadian dollar.
""I've lived in a lot of other bigger cities, and I wouldn't say I'm surprised that we have this here in Manitoba because we have a very supportive government and a very supportive community that has allowed us to do this here. Without that, and without them, this wouldn't be possible,"" said Duffy. ""In August, we made a blizzard in a commercial campaign, and now, in almost April, we're making the middle of winter, and that's something our crew can handle.""
On Thursday, more than 100 people gathered on a partially-closed section of Bannatyne Avenue to shoot the film's stars in a horse-drawn carriage.

Police were on hand, traffic was re-directed and a line of trailers stretched down two city blocks.
In one was a full kitchen with caterer Corby Pearce. Pearce has been catering movies for 13 years, and said the past few years he's seen higher quality shows, big names and bigger budgets.
""It's been pretty steady, good work for a good four years now. It's picked up quite a bit,"" said Pearce. ""It's not just me, but a couple hundred people that now have actual, steady work that can do what they do for a living without having to look for outside work.""
Pearce started Evolve Specialty Catering nine years ago, after spending years getting to know the business.
He said in the past, there were times where the company was waiting for business, trying to decide if they should take on other events and risk not being ready for a production when one showed up.
But now, he said, they're ""able to thrive,"" and ""reinvest ourselves into this business so we can do these jobs better, take on bigger productions, more productions.""
Expansion isn't just on Pearce's mind. Duffy said her production company is actively looking for more crew members, and Vivier said more big names are on their way to the province.

""I think it's going to continue. We have a great mix of the L.A.-production and the local production,"" said Vivier. ""We've had some great stars coming in and we've had them coming in for years and I don't expect that will change … Word of mouth is our best marketing.""

, but right now, the province is doing a return-on-investment review of Manitoba's arts sector.
The province will  with fiscal pressure a top priority, but Vivier said Manitoba Film and Music isn't worried the credit will get cut.
""I think the economics are so strong that we are not concerned that this sector isn't being recognized for the contribution it makes to the province,"" said Vivier. ""The current government in power, the [Progressive] Conservatives, are the ones who gave us the tax credit to begin with back in 1997.""

On Tuesday, Premier Brian Pallister wouldn't say anything about the future of the credit, but he did say a movie scout had been out to his house about potentially using it in shooting for the next instalment in the Chucky horror movie franchise.
""I think Manitobans are excited when they see Winnipeg or Manitoba featured in a Hollywood film,"" he said. ""I think it's got some benefits in terms of promoting other aspects of our province. I know the industry has been an important job creator to our province and a growing cultural industry in our province.""
Pallister said he wasn't able to offer up his house for the shoot, but he was a fan of the movies.

The Regina Corona Music Box was more likely playing tunes dating back to yourgreat-great-grandfather's day.
The Dundee Arms Inn and Restaurant in Charlottetown has had one of the music boxes in its lobby for the past two years.
""It was bought at an auction and taken here,"" said manager Pat Sands.
""The owner of the building thought it was a good place for it.""

While Sands wouldn't say how much the owner paid for the music box, similar ones online sell for close to $25,000. 

Most guests don't even notice the fine piece of antique furniture until Sands decides to pull out one of the giant tin discs.
""This one here is called  and apparently it was quite popular and it's dated 1893.""

The machine is easy to operate. Simply twist the dial for your favourite musical selection, drop in a coin, and wind the two cranks.

Whenever Sands plays the music machine, it draws a little crowd.
""A lot of the guests want to hear it,"" she said.

""They're amazed actually, it sounds really good.""


The Dundee Arms music box only has six discs — which came with it when it was purchased. The original machines came with 12 discs, and Sands hopes to buy more. 
They run about $40 each.

It only costs a nickel to play a tune on the music machine, so it could be another century before the owner recoups the price of the music machine.

 uses everything from beading to weaving to digital storytelling to illustrate how sexual violence impacts the victims and investigators.
""Art is a great leveler. It's something that brings people to their own deepest place where they can tell their own personal stories and it's also a great way to share your story with someone else, "" said Gwen O'Reilly, the director of the Northwestern Ontario Women's Centre in Thunder Bay.

Eight male and female officers of various ranks, along with nine women of diverse backgrounds, who range in age from 20 to 60, are participating in the project.
Survivors share stories of the impact of trauma, such as addictions and mental health issues, as well as tales of resilience and recovery said Emmy Pantin, the lead artist and co-director of the Community Story Strategy.
Police spoke about why they chose that line of work and why they care about it, but they also ""expressed how much it hurts them that they know that women are scared to call them,"" said Pantin, adding that the officers, like the survivors, are frustrated with the shortcomings of the justice system.
""They know that, in the end, a lot of women don't get justice and that they're only a piece of it, but they're the face of it,"" she continued.
""They do what they can but they need the court system — judges and lawyers — to do their piece, and they want to work with the community and to work with survivors to seek justice."" 
The two groups had ""more similarities than you might think,"" said O'Reilly.

""Both women survivors and police officers experience PTSD,"" O'Reilly said.
""Police talk about being hyper-vigilant and that when they walk into a room, they're checking to make sure it's safe and I said 'oh, that's what we see with survivors.' They really expressed a sense of powerlessness,"" she said.
The first phase of the project saw the two groups working separately but along parallel paths, said Pantin.
In phase two, which is expected to begin in mid-April, police and survivors will come together to share the short videos they've created and then work as one group on a new digital story.

cf0caa65837b8e0fe4b90da47f3f5ffadca4e3cc,The Associated Press,2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,"Roger Ailes, Fox News hit with new allegation of sexual harassment","Fox News contributor came forward to level more sexual-harassment allegations against deposed chief executive Roger Ailes on Monday, two days after it was revealed the network's most popular on-air personality, Bill O'Reilly, has settled multiple complaints about his own behaviour with women.
O'Reilly returned to the air on Monday following a weekend report in The New York Times that he and his employer had paid five women $13 million US to settle allegations of sexual harassment or other inappropriate conduct by Fox's ratings king. He made no mention of the case on his show.
Meanwhile, the lawyer for another woman who says she was punished for rebuffing O'Reilly's advances called on New York City's Human Rights Commission to investigate O'Reilly's behaviour.
The new lawsuit against Ailes was brought by Fox's Julie Roginsky and is notable because it accuses Fox's current management of trying to cover up for Ailes.
Roginsky said Ailes, who lost his job last summer following sexual-harassment complaints he has denied, suggested she have sex with ""older, married, conservative men."" She said Ailes would insist upon a kiss hello at their meetings, requiring her to bend over so he could look down her dress.
She was seeking a permanent role on Fox's show . But after an April 2015 meeting at which she turned down Ailes' advances, he wouldn't meet with her again, and she never got the regular role, she said.
Later, she said, she was pressured to join the so-called Team Roger, a group of people who publicly defended Ailes when the first harassment complaint made public against the Fox boss was brought by Gretchen Carlson last summer. Roginsky refused.
She said that even though Fox executives knew she had her own harassment allegations against Ailes, she was never encouraged to speak to the law firm hired by Fox News parent 21st Century Fox to investigate claims against him. And she said Fox never looked into her charges. Her lawyer would not say Monday why Roginsky never contacted the firm on her own.

Roginsky said that during a meeting in December, new Fox top executive Bill Shine told her he didn't believe the allegations against Ailes until recently. But the lawsuit alleges Shine and other top Fox executives should have known about Ailes's behaviour much earlier.
""Shine and other senior executives kept Ailes's conduct secret and enabled it,"" said the lawsuit, filed in state court.
Fox News representatives did not immediately return messages for comment. But Fox's new human resources chief sent a memo to staff late Monday, saying that ""in light of some of the accounts published over the last few days,"" he wanted to make clear the various avenues network employees could take if they had concerns about behaviour in the workplace.

Roginsky said she believes Shine hasn't given her an opportunity for advancement in retaliation for her harassment complaint and her refusal to speak out against Carlson.
At a Los Angeles news conference Monday, lawyer Lisa Bloom detailed allegations against O'Reilly by Wendy Walsh, a regular guest on the prime-time show .
Bloom said O'Reilly had told Walsh he would recommend her for a paid contributor role on the network. Walsh and O'Reilly had dinner in Los Angeles in 2013, but when Walsh refused his invitation to go to his hotel room, his attitude changed and she was soon dropped from the show, according to Walsh.
Bloom was seeking an investigation by the city Human Rights Commission. A spokesman for the commission said no claim had been filed. Claims have to address activity that happened within the city's five boroughs and must be filed within one year of an alleged infraction.
Walsh said she came forward because she was told by a Times reporter that many of the women who have accused O'Reilly of harassment are bound by gag orders. She said she is not bound by any such agreement, and the statute of limitations for suing has run out.

""Nobody can silence me because my voice is not for sale,"" Walsh said. ""Nobody can buy my voice.""
O'Reilly said over the weekend he is vulnerable to lawsuits from people who threaten to cause him bad publicity unless they get paid. He said he had ""put to rest any controversies"" to spare his children.
O'Reilly's ratings have gone up over the past year with the intense interest in politics. Independent studies show he generates more than $100 million in advertising revenue per year for TV's top-rated cable news network. But at least one advertiser, car company Mercedes-Benz, said it was pulling its ads from the show because of the ""disturbing"" allegations.
Hyundai said it had ads planned to run during O'Reilly's hour but are reallocating them ""due to the recent and disturbing allegations.""",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/fox-news-sexual-harassment-claims-1.4054158?cmp=rss

""The story I have heard the most is that at one point Doris was up for a role when quite young and her age may have been miswritten on the audition form. We don't know if that's correct, but if so it could've simply stuck for all these years.""
He said Day and White had long joked about White being two years older.
""Now we know that they are actually just a couple months apart, and turns out it's an even bigger exciting landmark than we thought,"" Walters said. White was born in January 1922.

On previous birthdays, Day has said she doesn't care about her age but rather using the occasion to highlight her favourite cause: animals.

A longtime supporter of animal welfare, Day founded the non-profit Doris Day Animal Foundation in 1978 to provide grants to projects that rescue, care for and protect animals. Among the wide-ranging recipients: a group that helps seniors and others with pet care needs; one that provides trained service dogs for veterans and others; Iowa Parrot Rescue, and Misfit Acres, a Minnesota horse sanctuary.
Day, who lives in Carmel, Ca., has effectively parlayed her fame for her mission. This year, she's seeking to bring younger people on board with a social media campaign that asks people to post a photo or video of their pet with the hashtag #DorisBirthdayWish and the tag @DDAF_org for her foundation. The best of the submissions will be combined into a digital birthday card for her.

Famous friends and admirers are among those saluting Day online. Country music star Reba McEntire tweeted that she was donating to the foundation and invited her Twitter followers to do the same.
Day, who started out as a big band singer, made her film debut in 1948 with  before starring in a string of smash-hit 1950s and '60s rom-coms. She remained a pop star as well, with hits including  and .
 earned her an Academy Award nomination, and she won critical acclaim for dramatic turns in  and . But Oscar gold, including the lifetime achievement award that her career justifies, hasn't come to her.
Yet Day, who once dismissed her ""goody two shoes"" image as ""so boring,"" isn't necessarily predictable: Walters said she has been offered the honorary award several times and politely declined. She always concludes, he said, in a ""classic Doris tone — 'Never say never!""'",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/doris-day-birthday-1.4052765?cmp=rss

J.Crew chief executive Millard Drexler told trade publication Business of Fashion he and Lyons agreed it was time for a change at the brand.
Like many fashion retailers, J. Crew is being squeezed by fast fashion, high rents and changing consumer tastes.
There will be pressure on Sikhounmuong to create a new aesthetic that captures the imagination of U.S. buyers.
He is to oversee women's, men's and children's design teams while Drexler takes charge of other creative departments.
Sikhounmuong grew up in Oshawa, Ont., and moved to New York at age 18 to study design.
He'll be in Toronto later this week as a judge of the .

Lyons is credited with creating a fresh image for J. Crew in the 1990s with bright colours and preppy styles.
She will remain a creative adviser at the company through this year, but has not said what her future plans are.
""It has been beyond my wildest dreams to work with such an amazing team of people at such an incredible brand and alongside Mickey—one of retail's most talented visionaries,"" Lyons said in a statement.

Attorney Stephen Hofer wrote in a statement that the Federal Aviation Administration will not fine Ford and the actor will retain his pilot's license without restriction.

Ford mistakenly landed on a taxiway at John Wayne Airport in Orange County on Feb. 13 after .
""I'm the schmuck who landed on the taxiway,"" Ford told an air traffic controller shortly after the landing.

That's because Downie took home two of the night's seven prizes: songwriter of the year for his solo  project along with group of the year for fronting the Tragically Hip.
Downie did appear over video however, thanking the crowd for embracing and ""recognizing our friends who were here before us."" The album tells the story of 12-year-old Chanie Wenjack, who died after running away from a residential school in 1966.

The Hip's Rob Baker and Paul Langlois were there to accept the group of the year prize on behalf of Downie and the rest of the band. And when their speech ran long, the show's producers tried to play them off the stage with music.
""Oh, you're actually going to play me out?"" said Langlois, as he kept running through his list of people to thank.
At that point, the band's hit starting playing. He fired back by taunting the producers. ""Go to commercial, go ahead,"" Langlois said. ""This is my arena, not yours.""

And that's precisely what the producers did, muting his mic and cutting to a commercial break. It was by far the most spontaneous moment in what was rather a pretty predictable live show, held at Ottawa's Canadian Tire Centre.


That's not to say the show wasn't entertaining. Russell Peters returned for his third stint as host, joined by Bryan Adams, who was hosting for the first time. The show started with Peters giving the rookie Adams advice: ""Try not to s--- the bed.""
It set the tone for Peters' jokes, familiar to anyone who has watched his stand-up specials or his past Juno hosting gigs in 2008 and 2009. Nothing and no one was off limits, with Peters ribbing Ben Mulroney, Thunder Bay, Ont. and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in attendance.

""Oh my god, that reminds me, I left my dog in the car,"" he said after bringing up Sarah McLachlan,

The tribute was introduced by the prime minister and his wife, Sophie. They fondly recalled Cohen, who served as an honorary pallbearer at Pierre Trudeau's funeral and was a friend of the Trudeau family.

Cohen's son, Adam, said he was moved by Feist's rendition of his father's tune.
""It takes a certain amount of courage to do something as stripped down as she did,"" he told reporters backstage.

But new research suggests that video chat in the workplace can hurt your performance on the job.

In video chat apps — like Skype, Google Hangouts or FaceTime — you get to see the people on the other end of the call. But you also see yourself, off to the side or down in the corner in a small window.
If you stop and think about it, the ability to see yourself in a meeting is kind of unusual. In a face-to-face meeting, you can't see yourself.  wanted to know: Is the ability to see yourself during a video call a good thing or a bad thing? Or, as assistant professor of management Martin Hassell puts it: ""How does someone seeing their own video feed affect their communication?""
In other words, Hassell and his colleagues wanted to find out if seeing your own video feed has a measurable impact on teamwork, collaboration or job performance.


They designed an experiment with two separate groups. Each group participated in a video conference and were asked to complete a task together. Basically, they had to solve a problem that involved a lot of communication and collaboration, all of which happened over video chat.
The only difference was that in the first group, participants could see their own video feed while the second group couldn't. Afterwards, the researchers measured how well the team accomplished their task, how long it took them and how satisfied they were, both with the process and their solution.

This is where things get really interesting, according to Hassell: ""On average, there was a significantly higher level of performance for the teams where the individuals did not see themselves when they were communicating. We also found that there were some differences in satisfaction among the teams: the individuals who did not see themselves on the camera felt more satisfied with the entire communication.""
The researchers don't have a definitive answer as to why this is. But they suspect it's related to what psychologists call ""objective self-awareness."" When you see yourself on-screen, it takes your focus away from the task at hand. You're thinking about how you look, sound and act, instead of focusing on the work.


The paper makes a number of recommendations. The first is simply to be aware of this phenomenon: to know that if you're seeing yourself on-screen in a video conference, there's a chance it's negatively impacting your teamwork and collaboration. He also has recommendations for app makers and video chat service providers: ""Put in the functionality so that a person has control over whether they see their own feed or not."" 
Hassell says most video chat apps don't have the option to turn off your own video feed. But, if you can turn it off, you should. And if you can't, he recommends trying to ignore it. Your performance at work should improve, he says.
There's also a low-tech way to deal with this: you can put a sticky note on your monitor to cover up your own image.


The short answer is that remote work, virtual teams and video conferencing are on the rise. An estimated 46 per cent of organizations use virtual teams, and in a report last year from the International Data Group, about 75 per cent of senior managers are expected to replace conventional conferencing technologies with video conferencing.
If the trend is towards more virtual teams and more video conferencing, we need to question some of the design decisions inherent in these technologies and better understand how these new technologically mediated forms of work actually impact the work that's happening. Because, speaking personally, I'm on a lot of video calls, and I'd like to avoid having a sticky note permanently attached to my screen.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/videoconferencing-workplace-productivity-1.4053566?cmp=rss

ee8e1dead5966bfe8fe8ee2bdb13a5fbcf714571,Reuters,2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,Trump signs repeal of broadband internet privacy rules,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday signed a repeal of Obama-era broadband privacy rules, the White House said, a victory for internet service providers and a blow to privacy advocates.
Republicans in Congress last week narrowly passed the repeal of the privacy rules with no Democratic support and over the strong objections of privacy advocates.
The signing, disclosed in a White House statement late on Monday, follows strong criticism of the bill, which is a win for AT&amp;T Inc., Comcast Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc.

The bill repeals regulations adopted in October by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers' privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc.'s Google or Facebook Inc.
The rules had not yet taken effect but would have required internet providers to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children's information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai praised the repeal in a statement late on Monday for having ""appropriately invalidated one part of the Obama-era plan for regulating the internet.""
Pai said the FCC would work with the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees websites, to restore the ""FTC's authority to police internet service providers' privacy practices.""
Republican FCC commissioners have said the Obama rules would unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers.
The action is the latest in a string of reversals of Obama administration rules. On Monday, the FCC reversed a requirement that Charter Communications Inc. extend broadband service to one million homes that already have a high-speed provider.

On Friday, Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T Inc. said they would voluntarily not sell customers' individual internet browsing information.
Verizon does not sell personal web browsing histories and has no plans to do so, but the company said it has two advertising programs that use ""de-identified"" customer browsing data, including one that uses ""aggregate insights that might be useful for advertisers and other businesses.""
The American Civil Liberties Union said last month Congress should have opposed ""industry pressure to put profits over privacy"" and added ""most Americans believe that their sensitive internet information should be closely guarded.""



Trade group USTelecom chief executive Jonathan Spalter in a statement praised Trump for ""stopping rules that would have created a confusing and conflicting consumer privacy framework.""
Last week, 46 Senate Democrats urged Trump not to sign the bill, arguing most Americans ""believe that their private information should be just that.""
Republicans later this year are expected to move to overturn net neutrality provisions that in 2015 reclassified broadband providers and treated them like a public utility — a move that is expected to spark an even bigger fight.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-sign-repeal-broadband-internet-privacy-rules-1.4049282?cmp=rss

Now they want others to see how a warming planet is melting masses of ice in a series of before and after photos.
In the Geological Society of America's GSA Today journal, a group of ice researchers and a photographer-filmmaker published pictures showing how several of the world's glaciers have thinned.

""There is something fundamentally compelling about the approach they take. For all our emphasis on models and math, seeing is still believing,"" said University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos, who wasn't part of the team.
Under natural conditions, glaciers melt and retreat at times while others grow and advance. But measurements from Earth's 5,200 glaciers show warming temperatures have increased the number of melting glaciers and the speed of glacial retreat, according to the study. Scientists primarily blame man-made global warming from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.
""There is something that touches the heart more profoundly when you see it in pictures than when you see it in maps or reports or graphs,"" said photographer James Balog, who founded the non-profit Earth Vision Institute. ""It certainly brings it alive.""

Last month, Salman Anwar noticed smoke coming from his Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge when he plugged it in to charge.
""It wasn't necessarily, like, tons of smoke coming out but I definitely sort of felt the phone overheating and then I saw vapours coming out,"" said Anwar.
""At first I couldn't believe my eyes, and then I hear crackling sounds coming from the charging port and then the smoke got a little bit worse. That's when I quickly unplugged it.""
Anwar said he usually charges his phone at night, next to his pillow.
""Had I not charged it earlier that day and that happened at night, I don't know if that could have progressed to something worse.""
Anwar, who is a medical student, said he often charges his phone while working at the hospital as well.

In a series of chat messages, emails and phone calls with Samsung, Anwar demanded a refund or a new, replacement phone, which he planned to sell and replace with a different brand of phone.

​Samsung offered to repair his phone and send it back to him, or provide an exchange with another refurbished phone, said Anwar.
But he said he didn't want another Samsung phone because he had lost trust in the brand.
""I told her that ... accepting a repair of that particular device was totally out of the question for me,"" he said.
""I said that I wanted a complete refund for the device and that I was going to switch over to a different brand.""
He added that his concerns were heightened by the well-publicized fire issue with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which was recalled in October 2016 after numerous reports that the devices had ignited. Those phones are now banned on all U.S. and Canadian flights.

Anwar said he was frustrated that the company had initially refused to provide a new phone, saying the company should have taken the complaint more seriously in light of the Note 7 issue.

But in an emailed response to questions, Samsung said on Monday it had offered to replace Anwar's phone with a new device.
""Customer safety and satisfaction remains our highest priority and we are committed to working with anyone who has experienced an issue with a Samsung product,"" wrote a Samsung Canada spokesperson.
Anwar said he received the offer on Monday morning, after previously being told that receiving a new device would not be possible.  
He replied to refuse the offer, having already switched to an iPhone.
""For a tech giant to give me so much trouble in replacing one single phone, given their history, just doesn't seem right,"" he said.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/smoke-samsung-galaxy-edge-phone-regina-1.4053551?cmp=rss

The tigers, which were being transported from Ukraine, arrived at the Beirut airport on March 7, inside a ventilated 0.3-cubic-meter crate, where they could not stand or move and were forced to urinate and defecate on each other, according to Animals Lebanon.

The animal rights group, which had been alerted to the shipment ultimately bound for Samer al-Husainawi Zoo in Damascus before it landed in Beirut, petitioned a Lebanese judge to release the tigers into their care the following week, Executive Director Jason Mier said.
The judge responded by issuing an order demanding the tigers be released, citing concerns for their health and welfare, the group said.
""Once we finally got them out of the box, the box had dozens and dozens of maggots crawling around in it. There were maggots all over the back thighs of the animals and around their anus,"" Mier said. The tigers also suffered from dehydration, according to the group.
The tigers were sent from the zoo in Mykolaev, Ukraine. Volodymyr Topchiy, that zoo's director, said the deal to send them abroad was entirely legal.
""They passed customs clearance, we have customs declarations,"" he said, adding that the tiger cubs were exchanged for some wildcats.

Topchiy believes problems with paperwork and bureaucracy stopped their transfer to Syria. ""On the transportation boxes there were no 'up' or down' signs,"" he said.
He said the three tiger cubs were in one box, not separate, and the zoo dealer was stopped because of these reasons. ""Authorities wanted to confiscate (the cubs),"" he said.
Mier said the crate arrived with no markings and no documents, and did not meet IATA regulations nor those of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, despite the fact that the four-month-old Siberian tigers fall under that category.

This is not the first deal that the Mykolaev zoo has made with its Syrian counterpart, and Topchiy said he is considering sending more tiger cubs there.
Lebanon enacted an animal protection and welfare law in 2015, granting animals legal rights and allowing for the regulation and monitoring of all the industries and establishments that use or sell animals to ensure that the animals are not placed in abusive environments.
The country is also a signatory to a number of international conventions regarding animal welfare, such as CITES, the main legislation against wildlife trafficking.
In August 2015, the death of a privately owned lion cub as a result of severe malnourishment prompted the Agriculture Ministry to clamp down on the sale and ownership of big cats.
In July, the ministry issued a decree to stop the trafficking of big cats and forcing zoos to register formally.

Bathrooms at tourist sites, notorious for their primitive conditions and nasty odours, are a special focus of the campaign, a response to a vast expansion in domestic travel and demands for better-quality facilities from a more affluent public.

""Today in China, people are highly enthusiastic about tourism, and we have entered a new era of public tourism,"" said Zhan Dongmei, a researcher with the China Tourism Academy. ""The expectation of the public for the toilet is becoming higher.""
At Beijing's 600-year-old Temple of Heaven, administrators recognized the need to stock the public bathrooms with toilet paper, a requirement for obtaining a top rating from the National Tourism Authority. But they needed a means of preventing patrons from stripping them bare for personal use — hence the introduction of new technology that dispenses just one 60-centimetre section of paper every nine minutes following a face scan.

""People take away the paper mostly because they are worried they can't find any when they want to use it the next time. But if we can provide it in every toilet, most people will not do it anymore,"" Zhan said.
Launched two years ago, the revolution calls for at least 34,000 new public bathrooms to be constructed in Beijing and 23,000 renovated by the end of this year. Authorities are also encouraging the installation of Western-style sit-down commodes rather than the more common squat toilets. Around 25 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) 4 856 315 000 has already been spent on the program, according to the National Tourism Administration.

The ultimate target, Zhan said, ""is to have a sufficient amount of toilets which are clean and odourless and free to use.""
At Happy Valley, the largest amusement park in Beijing, around 4 million annual visitors rely on 18 bathrooms, each of which is assigned one or two cleaners who must make their rounds every 10 minutes on busy days.
""People come here to have fun, but if the toilets are disgusting, how can they have a good time here?"" said Vice General Manager Li Xiangyang. ""It is the least we should do to offer a clean and tidy environment for tourists to enjoy both the tour of the park and the experience of using our toilets.""
Going a step further, the financial hub of Shanghai even opened its first gender-neutral public toilet in November in order to boost convenience and efficiency.
""Women are stuck waiting in longer lines for stalls than men, and it is fair for men and women to wait in line together,"" Shanghai resident Zhu Jingyi said after using the facility.
Zhan said the toilet revolution is about 90 per cent complete, but warned that it has yet to be won.
""We can't accept the situation that a lot of investments have been made to build toilets and they turn out to be unsanitary and poorly managed,"" he said.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-facial-recognition-toilet-paper-1.4052888?cmp=rss

And though the jets never entered operational service, the Arrow's legacy continues to inspire flight enthusiasts across the country.
Over the years, people have built replicas for display purposes, but a group of volunteers in Calgary have much higher hopes for their model — they're building a 0.6-scale replica of the famous jet that could one day take flight. 

""The Arrow was a unique achievement in technology,"" said Paul Gies, the president of the A.V. Roe Aviation Museum Association.
""It was unfortunate that that much technology and achievement was lost.""


Designed by A.V. Roe Canada in Malton, Ont., the Arrow was built to intercept Soviet bombers that might have entered North American airspace over the North Pole during the Cold War. 
Hailed for the advanced technology it represented, the program was halted suddenly on Feb. 20, 1959 by Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker.
The program, supported by his Liberal predecessor, Louis St. Laurent, was expected to have a final cost of $1 billion and was deemed too expensive. All existing prototypes were destroyed.

""It's almost legendary because of the way the program was terminated, but also what it did,"" said Gies. ""At the time it was built, it was the fastest, highest-flying aircraft. It was a program that put Canada on the forefront of aviation development.""

At a small hangar at Calgary's Springbank Airport, a handful of volunteers gather each Tuesday for build night.
They've been meeting over the last 20 years, and spent the first eight years in research and development.
Building a model of the plane will be difficult enough, but the group is also ensuring that the aircraft — called the Arrow II — is built to conform to the amateur build regulations of Canada, making it an even more painstaking process. 
""There are some departures [from the original plane] to make it compatible with how we have to fly it,"" Gies said. ""It will operate under a special certificate of airworthiness when we do fly it.""

Upstairs, Jason Palset is hard at work flying the Arrow through a simulator.
Seated in a makeshift cockpit in front of three large screens, Palset performs some aerobatics to demonstrate the capabilities of the Arrow, and then deftly lands the plane on the runway before taking off again.
""It's definitely a great machine,"" said Palset, as he banks sharply to the left over a simulated landscape of southern Alberta. 
""Every time I try something in the simulator and prove it, it comes out with the result I'm looking for,"" he adds. 

It's a labour of love for Palset, Gies and everyone else who works on the plane. They hope to flight test it within the next five to 10 years.
Gies says it's all about preserving the legacy of the Arrow. In addition to building the Arrow II, the group also operates the  and has built smaller models of the plane. 
""For me, the challenge of preserving that knowledge and that achievement, in addition to the challenge of building a flying replica of the aircraft, is what keeps me going,"" said Gies.

University of Calgary students Tyler Anker, Joel Neumann, Rohan Antony, Peter Hillman, Shalese Baxandall and Amanda Mackey invented what they're calling the ""Calgary Arm"" for the Schulich School of Engineering's Capstone Design Fair.
""The hope is that with really easily accessible materials, anyone within a developing nation could theoretically come up with their own materials and make their own prosthetic,"" Anker told the Calgary Eyeopener. ""Hopefully it can help someone out.""




At the end of the ""arm"" — which is an empty one-litre pop bottle with the bottom cut out of it — there's a balloon filled with sugar.
""When there's no vacuum applied to it, it's soft, so it can deform around any object,"" said Neumann.
Attached to the balloon is a bike pump that's been reversed, so it acts as a vacuum rather than a pump. The pump operates by pressing down on a loop of rope with your foot.

""When you apply the vacuum, it [the balloon] gets really hard, and then it can pick up the object,"" he said. ""As long as you can keep the vacuum on, the object is being grasped.""
It's called a jamming gripper, and is often used in robotics.
""It's so diverse, it can pick up different textured shapes and different sized shapes,"" Neumann said. 
The cost: $25.




Like any invention, the ""Calgary Arm"" has its flaws.
""In testing, the balloon really stretches out if you put a lot of weight on it,"" Anker said. ""After a kilogram or two, you're probably not going to get a lot of good out of it.""
It's also difficult to hold things for longer than 15 minutes, he added.
Anker, Neumann and the team are hoping to improve on the design and eventually send it out to those who may benefit from the device. 
The ""Calgary Arm"" will be on display along with other U of C engineering projects at the Capstone Design Fair.

50bfbcdd4786b97ec34b1ced7ddcedc061ded17e,Matthew Braga,2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,Groundbreaking AI researcher hopes for 'radically different' ideas from Toronto lab,"One of the biggest names in machine learning research has high hopes for the Vector Institute, . 
Geoffrey Hinton, considered one of the fathers of a popular branch of machine learning research called deep learning, is the institute's chief scientific adviser. He doesn't have any decision-making power — it's just a volunteer position — but he can suggest areas where the institute's researchers should focus their efforts. And he already has some ideas.

""My main interest is in trying to find radically different kinds of neural nets,"" said Hinton in an interview with CBC News. He was referring to problem-solving software designed to simulate the connections between neurons in the human brain.
Put another way, Hinton is keen on seeing the Vector Institute develop big ideas that will help researchers use today's computing technology in new ways, rather than merely building on existing techniques.
""Everybody right now, they look at the current technology, and they think, 'OK, that's what artificial neural nets are,'"" Hinton said. ""And they don't realize how arbitrary it is. We just made it up! And there's no reason why we shouldn't make up something else.""
The hope is that, by developing new types of neural networks that can be trained on ever increasing amounts of data, the performance of everything from self-driving cars to automated cancer screening could be dramatically improved.

Hinton, a former University of Toronto professor, has worked at Google as an engineering fellow . He runs the recently formed Toronto outpost of the company's machine learning division, Google Brain.
Hinton says that, while existing neural networks work very well, they haven't changed much since he started work on them in 1980s. That's where he sees an opportunity for researchers to shake things up with the development of ""radical variations.""
""The question is, can we make neural networks that are 1,000 times bigger? And how can we do that with existing computation?"" Hinton said. 
He offered one idea, from a recent paper on """" published by researchers at Google Brain, though still under review.

The cortex of a human brain boasts a vast network of sparsely connected neurons — too complex to simulate with the computer hardware that exists today. So researchers have been working with much smaller and more densely connected artificial networks instead.
The problem is that these dense networks aren't as efficient at processing massive amounts of data as the sparse networks of the brain. Training a dense artificial neural network involves all of the network's neurons, whereas in the brain, only a small fraction of neurons — the ones most suited to a particular task — are in use at any time.
And so Hinton and the Google Brain team have been working to simulate these sparse networks with a network of artificial neural networks that don't all have to be active at once.

In early research, the team has seen considerable improvements in language modelling and machine translation using the technique. 
Hinton offers it as an example of the sort of curiosity-driven basic research he'd like to see the Vector Institute do — the sort of blue-sky work that isn't always practical within many technology companies' application-driven research labs.
""My view is we should be doing everything we can to come up with ways of exploiting the current technology effectively,"" Hinton said. ""So there's lots of little ideas that you use to make things work better and exploit the current technology.
""But we should keep looking for big ideas that will make the current technology rather different.""",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/vector-institute-ai-toronto-geoffrey-hinton-deep-learning-1.4049858?cmp=rss
8f70132df0ffdc2b571a9afb8d6dbf6fafae2c32,Brandie Weikle,2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,Hard-working badger caught on video burying whole calf to feast on later,"An enterprising pair of badgers caught burying calf carcasses in the desert may help repair the animals' reputation as pests.
University of Utah biologists were observing scavenger behaviour in Utah's Great Basin Desert when they first witnessed an American badger do something no scientist had recorded before — completely bury an animal three to four times its size to feast on later.
But doctoral candidate Evan Buechley, lead researcher of a paper published Friday in the journal , didn't actually set out to make a discovery about badgers. 
In an interview with CBC News, Buechley said he planned ""to study what different scavengers are in the community and how they contribute to nutrient cycling and decomposition.""
He did this by staking the carcasses of seven calves to the ground and setting up cameras to capture what happened next. The stakes were used to prevent coyotes from carting the carcasses away and out of the view of the cameras.
But when Buechley returned two weeks later, one of the carcasses was missing.
""I was kind of disappointed because [setting them up] was a lot of work and then the carcass was gone so soon,"" he said. 

Buechley searched the area but didn't find any remnants of the calf that might be evidence of a scavenger feast.
""Then I went back to the site and noticed a big den hole, and so downloaded the photos right there at the site. I had my laptop with me, so I could look through the whole photo sequence,"" he said.
The images show that, over the course of five days, the industrious little guy worked night and day to dig around and under the calf until it collapsed — stake and all — into a hole. The badger then covered the animal and the hole in dirt. 



It turned out that a second badger had managed to do nearly the same thing to another calf carcass, but hadn't quite managed to get the calf's staked leg below ground.
Burying an animal to feast on later — a process biologists refer to as ""caching"" — effectively refrigerates it, preventing it from spoiling.

Undergraduate biology senior Ethan Frehner, lead author of the paper, said previous researchers had documented badgers burying small mammals such as jackrabbits and squirrels, but nothing as big as the calves.
""These carcasses are 20 to 30 kilograms, or three to four times the weight of a badger,"" Frehner told CBC News.

And about 100 times the size of a more typical badger find, the prairie dog, said Buechley. ""It was like hitting the jackpot. This was at least a solid month's worth of food.""
The cameras captured the badgers lying belly up in the sun and rolling around in the dirt.

""Not to anthropomorphize too much, but they seem pretty darn pleased with themselves,"" he said.

The findings could help to eventually change the perception of the humble animal, which has so far endured a reputation as a thorn in the side of ranchers.
""A large part of the concern is that the holes they dig, potentially trucks can drive into them and get stuck,"" said Frehner. ""Cattle have fallen into holes and potentially hurt their leg. This is the main cause of conflict between ranchers and badgers.""
Badgers have also been known to raid the odd chicken coop.
But this study opens the door to further investigation in how badgers might actually be more helpful to ranchers than previously thought, said Buechley.
For one thing, quickly burying a potentially diseased carcass could be helping to prevent the spread of disease to the herd, he said. 
In addition, removing a big food source means larger predators such as wolves and coyotes are less likely to be drawn to the area, said Buechley.
He adds that, in a world where science is trending toward big data, discovering this new animal behaviour speaks to the value of doing good old-fashioned natural history ""in your own backyard.""
""Just going out and spending time in the woods or in the deserts — there is still so many discoveries to be had.""",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/badger-buries-cow-research-1.4049432?cmp=rss

So scientists are considering a scheme to shade the atmosphere from the sun and cool Earth to compensate for global warming. It's a risky plan.
The concept is called . One of the ways it could work, scientists say, is by injecting tiny particles high into the atmosphere, where together they would act as a sun shield, reflecting sunlight back into space and cooling the planet.
It would be like turning down the thermostat on the enormous heat engine that drives the weather systems in our atmosphere.
The idea is not as wild as it sounds. Nature does this all the time with volcanoes.
When Mt. Pinatubo  in 1991, 20 million metric tonnes of sulphur dioxide was blown into the stratosphere. There the molecules reacted with  to form tiny particles that were carried on high altitude winds, producing a global haze. The average temperature of the Earth dropped by 0.5 C for more than a year after the eruption.

The geoengineering project would do the same thing on a much smaller scale, using a fleet of aircraft to spray  of sulphur dioxide, or some other material such as  into the .
From an astronomical perspective, the particles change the albedo of the planet, or how bright it is. White snow and ice do the same thing by reflecting sunlight and keeping arctic temperatures low.
That's one of the reasons why scientists are concerned about the loss of ice in the north. As the ice melts away, it exposes , which absorbs sunlight rather than reflecting it, raising the temperature.
Scientists estimate that by brightening the atmosphere with these particles, they could reflect  of sunlight back into space and provide enough cooling to balance the warming effect of the carbon emissions coming from industry.
Harvard Professor  estimates the project would have to be an international effort and cost about $1 billion to $10 billion per year. That sounds like a lot, but it pales compared to the U.S. military budget, for example, which is expected to increase to  in 2017.
The scientists also admit that this is a Band-Aid solution to a problem that should be fixed at the source. Of course, the best way to mitigate climate change is to reduce emissions. But since that doesn't seem to be happening — at least in the U.S., one of the world's largest emitters — we need to look at other options.

The first step is to do a small scale, proof-of-concept experiment with a high-altitude balloon called a . At an altitude of 20 kilometres, where the air is stable, a small propeller will drive the balloon forward as it releases a plume of particles that would stretch to about one kilometre in length.
The balloon will then turn around and fly back and forth through the plume to study how well the particles disperse over time. A follow-up experiment will examine any chemical reactions that take place between the particles and gases in the atmosphere. There is evidence that sulphates can destroy ozone, so care will be needed when choosing which type of compound to use.
The scientists are anxious to get the experiment underway. Many tests have been done in laboratories to prove this concept, but very little has been done in the atmosphere itself.

Not everyone agrees that solar geoengineering is a good idea. The Earth's atmosphere is a hugely complex system that can react in unpredictable ways. After all, we can't even predict the weather accurately beyond a week or two.
For the last approximately  years, we have been conducting an uncontrolled experiment by dumping greenhouse gasses into the air, affecting everything from monsoons to ocean currents and glaciers. So the idea of using what is effectively another pollutant to counter the problem seems like the wrong way to go.

It would be like standing in a crowded elevator where one person lights a huge cigar, filling the small space with smoke. But instead of asking the person to put it out, someone else sprays air freshener. It might make the elevator smell a little better, but it doesn't solve the problem
If the atmosphere can be sprayed and cooled artificially, that might become a licence for the big cigars around the world spewing carbon into the air to continue business as usual. That means carbon levels in the atmosphere will continue to rise, even though the planet is not getting warmer. And that is not good for ocean acidification and the bleaching of coral reefs around the world.
Solar geoengineering is a last resort in a warming world. Scientists hope that it will not be needed. But they are also say that the research needs to be done , so that if we do find ourselves in a desperate situation, we will know whether the air freshener approach will even work.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/bob-macdonald-blocking-sun-global-warming-1.4050149?cmp=rss

Opiods like morphine are addictive, have side effects and aren't that effective. Newer synthetic ones, like oxycodone and fentanyl, have the same issues and don't solve chronic pain. The unpredictability of both have cost thousands of lives.
The fang blenny, a fish found in the Great Barrier Reef, has potent venom that acts the same way as opioid drugs for killing pain. It could represent a new way to look at our most effective — and problematic — pain drugs.

Mostly because the ones currently on the market aren't that good. We have potent opiods that are incredibly addictive and have lots of other side effects, including constipation, dizziness, nausea and altered mental condition. Or we have weak ones that simply aren't that helpful for deep and chronic pain.

As things stand, we can go into the lab and tinker with existing drugs, and hope we can decrease addictiveness while maintaining potency. But so far, that hasn't exactly been very successful.
Another approach is to look to nature. Nature has had millions of years to tinker with biologically active chemicals. We don't necessarily know where to look for these, nor have the tools to begin a search. But chemicals that have evolved to kill pain without killing you are out there somewhere — in the fang blenny fish, for example. 


For one, it's adorable. In fact, it's actually a common aquarium fish. There are lots of different species, some that produce venom and some that do not. They can be quite colourful, from zebra-striped to bright yellow. Each variety has a proportionately massive set of fangs, often almost half the length of its skull.

One branch of the fang blenny family tree has coupled these massive chompers with a venom that helps defend it from predators and compete with other little fish.
""We expected this venom to be intensely painful, but instead the bites are actually pain free,"" says associate professor Bryan Fry, head of the venom evolution laboratory at the University of Queensland's school of biological sciences. ""What really surprised us was that [the fang blenny's] venom contains these opioid-acting peptides.""
""Now, they're not trying to do pain killing as the intended use of the venom, rather it's been selected for the side effects. Anybody who's ever taken a pain killer knows you get a bit woozy, your blood pressure goes down, you're not terribly on your game, so in this case they're using a form of chemical doping to win this competition.""


Likely yes, but it's only been tested on animals so far. However, the venom is not a mysterious new chemical; it's actually very similar to something we have in our bodies called enkephalin.
Because the chemical is a derivative of a type of peptide humans make naturally, says Fry, researchers are starting ""much further ahead of the game"" than they normally would be when exploring a potential new pain killer.

These enkephalins work like the natural pain killers in our own bodies. The question is, does the fang blenny version work better than our own? Are they more potent? Do they have fewer side effects? Most importantly, can we learn how they work and subsequently create a new drug?


There are a lot of hurdles between discovery to prescription-ready drug. The next step is to try to sequence more fang blennies. The expectation is that there could be as many as 200 different versions of these little proteins, or peptides that act like opioids, in the 12 or so venomous species of the fang blenny.
The goal now is to collect more samples, sequence the DNA and proteins, compare them to what we already know and see what kinds of variation is present in nature. Maybe nature has figured out something we would never even think of.
It certainly wouldn't be the first time. The most commonly prescribed drug for high blood pressure is captopril, a synthetic version of a snake venom. This new opioid from fang blennies has lots in common with captopril: it's protein-based which means it's relatively easily studied and mimicked and the small size means that, in pill form, it can easily cross out of the digestive tract and into the blood where it takes effect.
So the fang blenny's potential isn't just blue-sky thinking; there's a very real and somewhat straight path for studying this opioid to make it useable as a pharmaceutical.
The number one hurdle is the health of the Great Barrier Reef, where these fish live. There's an immense amount of unknown diversity in ecosystems around the world disappearing at unprecedented rates due to climate change, and the GBR is fragile among these. Current policies of both the Australian and American governments don't bode well for slowing climate change and preserving nature to its full potential to help us. 
Here's the key thing: a better opioid is worth tens of billions of dollars. The best source of inspiration for new pharmaceuticals is nature, and that's what we are destroying for a few million or even hundred million in the short term.
The reality is that the economic argument for conservation vastly outweighs the economic argument for destruction.The fang blenny populations are declining as the reef gets bleached and destroyed, and with it goes millions of years of perfecting potentially life-savings drugs for our use.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/tiny-fish-could-solve-opioid-crisis-1.4047312?cmp=rss
58432d4cf5b3cba030f7e0322fc0a63c58732625,Reuters,2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,"​SpaceX launches first reused rocket, testing cost-cutting model","SpaceX has launched its first recycled rocket.
The Falcon 9 rocket launched from the pad at Florida's Kennedy Space Center on Thursday evening. It was the first time SpaceX founder Elon Musk had tried to fly a salvaged booster. The first stage landed on an ocean platform almost a year ago after a launch for NASA. 
""This is a huge day. My mind's blown, frankly,"" Musk said. He called it an ""incredible milestone in the history of space"" and predicted, ""this is going to be a huge revolution in spaceflight.""
SpaceX refurbished and tested the booster, which still has its original engines. The booster also made a successful landing on a sea platform, which means it could be used for a third delivery mission. 
Musk's SpaceX, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp., made history in December 2015 when it landed an orbital rocket for the first time and has repeated the feat seven times.


By reusing rockets, SpaceX aims to cut its costs by about 30 per cent, the company has said. It lists the cost of a Falcon 9 ride at $62 million US but has not yet announced a price for flying on a used rocket. 
SES received a discount for joining the inaugural run, chief technical officer Martin Halliwell told reporters this week, declining to specify the cost. 

Price alone was not the reason SES, with a fleet of 65 satellites, decided to fly on a used rocket, he said. 
""Someone has to go first,"" Halliwell said. ""Really what we want to do here is encourage the launcher industry to follow this way forward."" 
Proving the concept works is crucial to SpaceX, which is moving on from an accident in September that damaged another Florida site.
SpaceX also is working on a passenger spaceship, with two unidentified tourists signed up for a future trip around the moon. The company's long-term goal under founder Musk is to fly people to and from Mars. 
For its 33rd mission, SpaceX is reusing a Falcon 9 booster that originally flew in April 2016. 

""We don't believe we're taking an inordinate risk here,"" said Halliwell, noting that the rocket is in sufficiently good shape that its launch insurance rates did not increase. 
He declined to give the cost of the SES-10 satellite. 
After sending the SES-10 satellite on its way to orbit, the rocket's first-stage will turn around and attempt to land itself on an ocean platform. If successful, SpaceX could fly the booster a third time, said company spokesman John Taylor. 
The rocket's second-stage, which is not recovered, will continue firing to carry SES-10 into an initial egg-shaped orbit high above Earth. It will provide TV and other communications services to Latin America.       ",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/spacex-test-reusing-booster-1.4047216?cmp=rss

Speaking at an Arctic forum in northern Russian city of Arkhangelsk, Putin also said Russia's shipping and energy projects in the Arctic were guided by the principle that they should do no harm to the environment.
Earlier in the day Putin saw via video link an ice-breaking tanker docking for the first time at Russia's Arctic port of Sabetta to test a new route that could open the ice-bound Arctic Ocean to ships carrying oil and liquefied gas.

The route is eagerly anticipated by energy firms that want to develop resources in the Arctic but face obstacles in getting oil and gas from remote and freezing fields to world markets.
Environmental activists fear commercial shipping in the Arctic — now possible because climate change has thinned the ice for part of the year — will allow exploitation of a region that up to now has been a pristine wilderness.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/russia-putin-climate-change-beneficial-economy-1.4048430?cmp=rss

Pallister says he was approached late last year by a site locator who wanted to use his waterfront home for the horror movie , which has been filming in different areas of Winnipeg.
The film is the seventh in the  franchise, which focuses on a doll that is possessed by the spirit of a serial killer.

Pallister's home is among the biggest in Winnipeg — a 9,000-square-foot mansion valued at more than $2 million.  
The premier says it would have been fun to see his house on the big screen.
But he and his family did not want the home to be opened up to a movie crew.
""The idea of my wife and children and I making it up the carpet at the Academy Awards to see our home on display ... would have been great, but unfortunately we just weren't able to offer up our home,"" Pallister said Tuesday.

Pallister praised the number of Manitoba locations that have appeared in Hollywood movies, including the provincial legislature, which was seen in the 2005 movie starring Philip Seymour Hoffman.
But he appeared to have his tongue in cheek when talking about the franchise, which has never been nominated for an Academy Award.
He called the offer a chance to ""get involved in an ostensibly fabulous Hollywood production of fine quality.""  
""I tell you, those Chucky films get better and better. The more they produce, the better they get.""
Opposition New Democrat legislature critic Wab Kinew joked that a movie about a doll that attacks people with scissors might be apt for Pallister, whose Progressive Conservative government has been focused on spending restraint.

The Regina Corona Music Box was more likely playing tunes dating back to yourgreat-great-grandfather's day.
The Dundee Arms Inn and Restaurant in Charlottetown has had one of the music boxes in its lobby for the past two years.
""It was bought at an auction and taken here,"" said manager Pat Sands.
""The owner of the building thought it was a good place for it.""

While Sands wouldn't say how much the owner paid for the music box, similar ones online sell for close to $25,000. 

Most guests don't even notice the fine piece of antique furniture until Sands decides to pull out one of the giant tin discs.
""This one here is called  and apparently it was quite popular and it's dated 1893.""

The machine is easy to operate. Simply twist the dial for your favourite musical selection, drop in a coin, and wind the two cranks.

Whenever Sands plays the music machine, it draws a little crowd.
""A lot of the guests want to hear it,"" she said. 

""They come in for lunch and dinner, and those who stay over, we always play it for them.""
The music box only has one volume — and that's medium, but the sound fills the lobby, dining room and pub, and guests seem to like it.
""They're amazed actually, it sounds really good.""


The Dundee Arms music box only has six discs — which came with it when it was purchased. The original machines came with 12 discs, and Sands hopes to buy more. 
They run about $40 each.

It only costs a nickel to play a tune on the music machine, so it could be another century before the owner recoups the price of the music machine.

40601147ce5be882103cd0cb1462c87de1ae45f4,The Associated Press,2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,China introduces facial recognition technology to dispense toilet paper,"Fed up with the theft of toilet paper from public bathrooms, tourist authorities in China's capital have begun using facial recognition technology to limit how much paper a person can take.
The unusual move — part of a ""toilet revolution"" — is another step in China's vast upgrading of public facilities.
Bathrooms at tourist sites, notorious for their primitive conditions and nasty odours, are a special focus of the campaign, a response to a vast expansion in domestic travel and demands for better-quality facilities from a more affluent public.

""Today in China, people are highly enthusiastic about tourism, and we have entered a new era of public tourism,"" said Zhan Dongmei, a researcher with the China Tourism Academy. ""The expectation of the public for the toilet is becoming higher.""
At Beijing's 600-year-old Temple of Heaven, administrators recognized the need to stock the public bathrooms with toilet paper, a requirement for obtaining a top rating from the National Tourism Authority. But they needed a means of preventing patrons from stripping them bare for personal use — hence the introduction of new technology that dispenses just one 60-centimetre section of paper every nine minutes following a face scan.

""People take away the paper mostly because they are worried they can't find any when they want to use it the next time. But if we can provide it in every toilet, most people will not do it anymore,"" Zhan said.
Launched two years ago, the revolution calls for at least 34,000 new public bathrooms to be constructed in Beijing and 23,000 renovated by the end of this year. Authorities are also encouraging the installation of Western-style sit-down commodes rather than the more common squat toilets. Around 25 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) 4 856 315 000 has already been spent on the program, according to the National Tourism Administration.

The ultimate target, Zhan said, ""is to have a sufficient amount of toilets which are clean and odourless and free to use.""
At Happy Valley, the largest amusement park in Beijing, around 4 million annual visitors rely on 18 bathrooms, each of which is assigned one or two cleaners who must make their rounds every 10 minutes on busy days.
""People come here to have fun, but if the toilets are disgusting, how can they have a good time here?"" said Vice General Manager Li Xiangyang. ""It is the least we should do to offer a clean and tidy environment for tourists to enjoy both the tour of the park and the experience of using our toilets.""
Going a step further, the financial hub of Shanghai even opened its first gender-neutral public toilet in November in order to boost convenience and efficiency.
""Women are stuck waiting in longer lines for stalls than men, and it is fair for men and women to wait in line together,"" Shanghai resident Zhu Jingyi said after using the facility.
Zhan said the toilet revolution is about 90 per cent complete, but warned that it has yet to be won.
""We can't accept the situation that a lot of investments have been made to build toilets and they turn out to be unsanitary and poorly managed,"" he said.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-facial-recognition-toilet-paper-1.4052888?cmp=rss

""If you can sell a condo in Vancouver for a couple million bucks, you can come up here and get five acres and a lifetime worth of work if you really enjoy working on cars,"" said seller Michael Hall.
The five-acre listing comes complete with a renovated home, property zoned for auto salvage, a 900-square-foot restoration shop, a 1,200-square-foot steel building and hundreds of vintage cars ready to be restored.
""Since we advertised the property a few days ago, I've had more than 15 inquiries a day,"" said Hudson Purba, Hall's real estate agent.
Hall and Purba both stressed that the property as a whole is for sale, and inquiries about individual vehicles will not be taken.
In his 11 years as a real estate agent, Purba has never had a listing quite like this.


Hall, a rock scaler and business-owner, started collecting vintage cars 40 years ago.
He was living in Kamloops when his collection grew to a point where he says the city ""bugged him"" so he and his wife moved to a farm where he could keep his collection.
He bought an auto-wrecker from a friend and continued to add to his collection.
""I've added another 150 or 200 [cars] in the last three of four years and it just sort of exploded exponentially from there so to speak.""
Take a look at what the property looks like:

Some of the cars he's been especially proud of over the years include a 1968 Chevelle SS 396 four-speed (which he won't be selling), a 1941 three window Dodge business coupe and even a DeLorean.
Hall has been working to build a list of what vehicles are part of the listing, but his phone has been ringing off the hook since the listing went up and he hasn't had time.

Hall says his wife isn't as crazy for cars as he is.
""We have an arrangement. She lives on the 26-acre farm and I live with the 300-400 cars,"" he said. ""She finally said, 'enough.'""

Hall is reluctant to make the sale, but he sees the value in listing the property and all the cars.
""It's not like I can just walk away from $1.5 million worth of cars and property,"" he said.
""I never really thought about it, but if they're all gone it's going to leave a pretty big void in my life,"" he said.
""It's kinda like getting kicked square in the you-know-whats,"" he added.  
Hall says his car-buying habits are somewhat of an addiction, but he is willing sacrifice his ""insane hobby"" to make money for him and his family.

So what do the experts say? Do these picturesque spring phenomena have a colder, more scientific name?
""I would call it a 'concretion',"" wrote Dr. Joel Cubley, a geologist at Yukon College.

""I'm not a sedimentary geologist per se, but in my opinion you can get concretions one of two ways — either precipitation from solution onto a preexisting nucleus in a static environment, or rolling of a nucleus in an agitated, higher energy environment,"" he wrote.
""The snowball would use the latter rolling mechanism.""
Meanwhile, James Floyer, a forecaster with Avalanche Canada, says he's always known them as ""pinwheels"".
""Often you see them underneath cliffs, or where there might be trees or something that creates a little bit of movement onto the snow. And then you need a steep enough slope for these to roll down and keep going,"" he said.
The crucial ingredient, though — to make eye-catching pinwheels — may be a visible layer of dirt on the slope's surface.
""I think that'd help to highlight the rolls a little bit, in the same way that someone sprinkling cinnamon onto a pastry and then rolling it up for a cinnamon roll — you'd sort of see the layers in there a little bit more,"" Floyer said.
Floyer admits he doesn't like to see them on steep mountainside, as they're a sign the snow pack is losing strength.
But out of avalanche country, he says, ""they're pretty, absolutely.""

It's a question being asked more often in Windsor, Ont., as the big-bodied birds have begun popping up around the city in recent months, causing 'fowl' moods on the University of Windsor campus as they stalled traffic by walking in the middle of the road.

""Turkeys roam wild and free through the city of Windsor,"" said naturalist Karen Cedar. ""At this time of year you'll often see the males fanning out their tails and strutting around showing off for all the females and that can be a bit of a traffic-stopper.""
Andy Breschuk has captured several of the urban turkeys on camera. The typically wild animals have seemed a bit out of their element with Detroit's glittering skyline in the background.

On Friday, he bumped into an especially bold bird on Glengarry Avenue next to Caesars Windsor.
""I thought 'Boy, this is odd,' [the turkey] was walking right by so maybe he's been around for a while,"" said Breschuk. ""It was just on the side of the road, eating and pecking.""


A turkey's diet can consist of everything from berries to baby turtles and snakes, according to Cedar.
Combine that with their only typical predators in the area being coyotes and cars, and a turkey is bound to spread its wings a bit.



Essex Region Conservation Authority biologist Dan Lebedyk said turkeys typically prefer to stick to the country to avoid people, but cautioned drivers to be careful around the new city-savvy breed that seems to be moving in.
""They can get as big as your typical grocery store turkey,"" he joked, adding that doesn't include the feathers.

It's only the third time in Crayola's long history that it has retired one or more colours, and the first time it's swapped out a color in its box of 24.



Other colours that previously got the boot include maize, raw umber and orange yellow.
Crayola crayons were first produced in 1903 by Binney &amp; Smith Co.
Crayola is based in Easton, Pa., and is a subsidiary of Hallmark Cards Inc., headquartered in Kansas City, Mo.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/crayola-dandelion-dropped-1.4049587?cmp=rss

The Regina man is a cabinet-maker, but he also has a special project on the side called Big Time Furniture. Rieger makes coffee tables that look just like classic Nintendo Entertainment Systems.

""I was originally thinking I'd do the more traditional style furniture, or maybe something a little more funky,"" he said. ""I had this concept in mind and I thought, 'Let's give this a try.'""
He said he doesn't consider himself a 'gamer,' but he has a soft spot for the 'old school' video games he played when he was young.
""As a kid I was hardcore into gaming,"" he said, laughing. ""I had a Nintendo Entertainment System. I got it as a birthday gift when I was 12 and it was probably the best gift I ever had. That's all I wanted to do, basically.""

He didn't know if anyone would want to buy his first Nintendo furniture piece, but when he posted it on Facebook, he got an offer right away. Now, he's getting requests from all over Canada, the United States, and even Europe.
He hasn't stopped at the coffee tables, which come in at $1,000 or $1,200 depending on whether you want a realistic drawer that opens just like the original consoles. He's made matching side tables that look like Nintendo controllers, others that look like Lego, and a table that looks like a cassette tape.

Rieger knows he's not the only guy making these kind of items, but as far as he knows, he's the only one in Saskatchewan.
""It's niche stuff that maybe is not everybody's bag, but I think most people can appreciate it, and appreciate the skill and time that I take to work on it,"" Rieger said.

e01da6a6f48fa22b6407ac98d65ab76424342142,CBC News,2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,'That poor chicken': Alberta farmer weighs in on behemoth Ontario egg ,"It's the talk of the farm.

Alberta poultry producers are clucking over a record-setting egg laid by an Ontario hen.

Weighing in at a staggering 180 grams, the egg is the size of a substantial apple and weighs more than a major league baseball.

Dennis Goslow, a hobby farmer near Sault Ste. Marie, discovered the mammoth shell in his roost last week, and has been cracking international headlines ever since.


""I thought, that poor chicken,"" Morinville poultry farmer Paul Wurz said with a chuckle during an interview with CBC Edmonton's Radio Active.
""That is one big, big egg.""

Wurz, manager of the Morinville Colony poultry farm, said laying such a big egg would be hard on any bird, and that the hen responsible for the oblong whopper may be an empty-nester for some time.

""If it's a bigger-framed chicken, it will hurt her but it won't hurt her as much as if it was a smaller chicken,"" said Wurz, who manages the 20,000-hen laying barn. ""When they do that, it's a while before they lay another one.


""A big one like that, she's probably still hesitating.""
Wurz knows a good egg. The Morinville Colony has raised laying hens at its farm northwest of Edmonton since 1970. 
Every day, more than 20,000 eggs are laid, washed and packed for market. Wurz has been in charge of the laying hens since he was 14, when his grandfather gave him the task.


While the uninitiated may still be scratching their heads over incident, Wurz has cracked the mystery.


Brown hens tend to lay larger eggs, and Wurz believes the well --intentioned Ontario farmer may be feeding his brood too much protein, which can alter the quality of their shells.

""With it being a backyard flock, they're probably feeding it a lot of vegetables, like dried tomatoes, spinach and lettuce and things like that,"" said Wurz, who won the Alberta egg farm of the year award in 2014.

""To lay an egg like that means that chicken got preferred treatment and was fed just way too much."" 

The record for the heaviest chicken egg in the world is 454 grams. The egg was laid by a hen in New Jersey in 1956. 


Wurz has his own personal record. Last summer, one of his hens laid a ""behemoth"" egg that weighed in at 122 grams.

""I kept it around for a while just to show people how big an egg can really get. I posted it on Facebook and got a few comments out of it,"" Wurz said. ""One of my restaurants actually wanted all eggs like that after that, and I said, 'No, no, no, my girl screwed up.' "" 


Though the egg earned Wurz some bragging rights with his farming friends, he won't be pushing his hens for a repeat performance.

""Some of the smaller ones, if they laid an egg that size, they'd be pretty much done,"" he said.

""I like my hens too much for that, I want to keep them around longer.""

Ken Nicholson was driving along a rural road around 9 a.m. Thursday when he says a lynx crossed right in front of his vehicle.
A sighting like that isn't all that rare for the Drayton Valley area southwest of Edmonton.
""They typically go into the bush a few feet and then they usually sit there, so they're pretty easy to get good video of,"" Nicholson said.

But when Nicholson reached for his phone to capture the moment, the cat ""started to vocalize,"" he said.
According to Nicholson, a lynx purring, meowing or growling can be a pretty good indication there are other big cats around.
When Nicholson started looking along the ground for lynx kittens, something caught his eye high up in the tree out the other side of his vehicle.
""I looked up and there was the one cat in the tree, obviously trying to find something to eat.""
Another lynx had evidently chased a squirrel high into the treetops and that's where the action begins in Nicholson's widely shared 42-second video.
""The squirrel kept jumping, went on to the ground and then up another tree. It was cat-and-mouse,"" he said.
""I've seen a lot of neat things out here but I've never seen anything remotely close to a lynx in a tree. It's a young cat. It was just going about trying to find something to eat the hard way, that's all there is to it.""

In the end, the squirrel got away and the two big cats carried on with their hunt.
""It looked like two juveniles to me, they weren't fully mature,"" Nicholson said. ""They were just young ones trying to find food and obviously they didn't have that much practice at it by the looks of it.""",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/drayton-valley-lynx-squirrel-1.4048692?cmp=rss

To celebrate Canada's 150th birthday, the council has set up a 1.8-metre-by-2.1-metre canvas in the town's art gallery and divided it into 6,048 squares. Now, it's trying to get a different person to fill each one of them in.

""When people come into the art gallery, we ask them if they want to participate,"" said the art council's president, Deborah Livingstone. ""We're keeping a very precise log for Guinness, so we record their name and where they're from and what square they've painted.""
If the painting is completed by December 23, it will secure a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for the most contributors to a single paint-by-numbers piece.
It's an ambitious goal, considering that Peachland is a small town in B.C.'s Okanagan Valley with a population of just over 5,000 people.
The painting is based on a photograph of Peachland from 1914.
""It was taken from the hillside,"" said Livingstone. ""[It shows] the Baptist church at the time, which is our museum today. It's a beautiful eight-sided heritage building.""

The picture also features the fruit packing houses that used to dominate Peachland's Beach Avenue and the S.S. Sicamous, a famous sternwheeler that used to traverse Okanagan Lake.
About 150 people filled in squares on the painting in the first week after it was opened to the public on March 24.

The idea to go for the record came from Shelley Sweeney, a director on the Peachland Community Arts Council.
""I honestly don't know,"" she says when asked where the inspiration came from. ""I was thinking of things the arts council could do to bring more people into our beautiful art gallery, highlight Peachland during the sesquicentennial and making sure that we have additional support from the community.""

To help it reach the record, the arts council is relying on out-of-town visitors like 9-year-old Parker Lakusta.
""I think it's a really fun way to have people get together for Canada's 150th anniversary,"" said Lakusta, who was visiting Peachland from Edmonton with his grandparents.
So how will he feel if he ends up having contributed to a record setting effort?
""Really cool,"" he says.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-art-gallery-goes-for-paint-by-numbers-world-record-1.4048807?cmp=rss

BooBoo went missing four years ago.

""We gave up looking and when we got this phone call it was completely out of the blue, nothing that we had ever expected,"" Aleman told CBC News.
This month, BooBoo turned up in Morriston in Puslinch Township, just south of Guelph, Ont., and was turned over to the Guelph Humane Society (GHS).
""We thought that maybe BooBoo was originally from California and the owners moved to Canada and forgot to change the microchip information,"" said Melissa Stolz, the animal program and intake coordinator for the GHS.
""But when we found out that no, they were all still in California, they lost the cat in California and somehow this cat ended up in Canada, is just baffling.""
The GHS called Aleman on March 17.
Stolz has been working with Aleman to get BooBoo back home over the past two weeks. Stolz said luckily the owner information in BooBoo's microchip stayed the same, so GHS was able to get in contact with the family.  

How BooBoo ended up in Canada, however, may always remain a mystery.
Aleman said that BooBoo had a habit of getting in people's cars and suspects that may have been how BooBoo's journey started.
Stolz said there have been cases in the past where cats get on a transport vehicle and accidently get transported over the border.  Another possibility could be that someone found her as a stray in California, moved to Canada and lost her.
""This cat came in very good shape and it's hard to believe that she hasn't been taken care of for the past three years,"" she said.
GHS is currently working to reunite Aleman and her family with BooBoo. Aleman said her mother will fly from California to Buffalo, New York, to meet a GHS animal protection officer who will have BooBoo.
""I already told my husband, you better prepare yourself because I'm going to lose it, I'm going to break down and I'm going to cry, because it was a hard thing to lose her,"" Aleman said about how she will feel when her mother returns with BooBoo later this week.

Belbeck Family Farm in Moffat, Ont., near Milton, is making their Rent The Chicken business  allows backyard chickens.
The farm already offers chicken rentals across southern Ontario with free delivery within 80 kilometres of Moffat, which covers Hamilton, Mississauga and much of Toronto.

Kate Belbeck said it's a great way to try it before you buy it.
""If you do jump into it and you find out it's not for you when you're renting, you have the option just to chicken out partway through,"" she said.
The rental comes complete with a coop, feed, treats, a book about how to care for backyard chickens and either two or four hens. Two hens will give you about a dozen eggs a week.
Belbeck said they have very few chickens returned.
""Most people are very, very excited to get their chickens and find that they're really not that difficult to look after,"" she said.
The majority of those who do return their chickens often have to because they've been reported for not following their municipality's bylaw regarding chickens, she said. 


The Belbecks also rent out incubators if people just want to watch the eggs hatch, and then they can send them back. This is popular with schools, daycares and long-term care facilities, she said.
Belbeck said the top question they get asked is about how hard it is to care for chickens.
""Chickens are very much like any other pet,"" she said.
You will need to feed and water them daily, collect the eggs daily and spend some time to clean the coop. Like any other animal, if you don't pick up their waste, it will start to smell.
Otherwise, chickens are quiet and have personalities, Belbeck said.
Rental packages are usually for six months, but Belbeck said people can rent them for winter. Or, if people don't want to have chickens in the winter months, they can request to get the same hens back the following year.",2017-04-04T19:46:18Z,www.cbc.ca,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/kitchener-backyard-chicken-rentals-1.4044077?cmp=rss

""I was looking for something strange and unusual,"" the Toronto man said.
Steele said he was impressed by the building, which contains 15 cells, a gym, a yard surrounded by chain-link fence topped by coiled barbed wire, and an apartment where the previous owner once lived.
He bought it. The closing date is June 1.
Former owner Andrew Partridge had the building on the market for two years. The last asking price was $159,000.

Steele said the building has a colourful past. It was built in 1800 when Dorchester, was a bustling centre of shipbuilding, and closed for good about 20 years ago.

""Something I'm looking forward to investigating further is the history of the Bannister brothers that were hung there,"" Steele said.
He's has also been contacted by some former inmates who've asked if they can revisit the building.
""You know, kind of get rid of some of the demons.""
He said he feels a responsibility to be compassionate about the requests.

He also likes the surrounding community that he's already begun to explore.
""The view is amazing. I love the community that it's in, that it was in the downtown part of Dorchester. I was just in awe.""

Steele said he was looking for a change of pace after 29 years of working as a transfer station operator for the city of Toronto.
""I decided to retire and cash out my pension. I've had enough, I'm 50 years old and you know, I'm not getting any younger, I feel great, I've never felt better so now's the time.""
He has been grieving the recent loss of his 25-year-old son, Billy, to heart failure. The purchase of a retirement property and relocating to the East Coast was something he had planned to surprise his son with. 
An antique dealer on the side and a self-described collector of unconventional items, Steele said he might open a shop or an inn of some sort. Friends and relatives are interested in visiting him once he moves into the former Dorchester lockup.
""I might even set up a curiosity museum,"" he said.
""It's going to be quite the adventure arriving there. I've gotten lots of messages from complete strangers welcoming me and offering to help me out.
