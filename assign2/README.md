#README for a2

This repository contains components for completion of the second assignment in SENG 474 at the University of Victoria.

Four components for this assignment:

q1 | perceptron.py
q2 | linear_regression.py
q3 | logistic_regression.pdf (TODO: ADD)
q4 | naive_bayes.py

All Python files were written for *Python 3.5.2* and tested in Windows environments.

These files require the following libraries to be added:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas

These packages can be fetched using pip.

Details on running each file will be added as these programs are completed.

## perceptron.py

## linear_regression.py


## naive_bayes.py
