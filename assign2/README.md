#README for a2

This repository contains components for completion of the second assignment in SENG 474 at the University of Victoria.

Four components for this assignment:

| Q# | Corresponding File      |
|----|:------------------------|
| q1 | perceptron.py           |
| q2 | linear_regression.py    | 
| q3 | logistic_regression.pdf |
| q4 | naive_bayes.py          |

All Python files were written for *Python 3.5.2* and tested in Windows environments.

These files require the following libraries to be added:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas

The three above libraries can be fetched using pip.

Details on running each file will be added as these programs are completed.

## perceptron.py

This program takes in a single input parameter: the file from which we are learning. A sample file, `bankruptcy.csv`, is provided. To run perceptron.py:

`python perceptron.py $inputfile`

After reading the contents of the input file, the perceptron algorithm will be applied to the input data. The list of corresponding w values is generated, from which the program derives a list of points to plot to the user's screen. 

## linear_regression.py


## naive_bayes.py
