'''
Written for Python 3.5.2

This program is an extension of the linear regression algorithm featured in this course.
This extension adds the following capabiltiies:
- Reading data from files
- Scaling attributes
- Computing error at each iteration and saving error values in a vector
- Plotting error vector as a curve for output
- Find a good learning rate based on error curve
